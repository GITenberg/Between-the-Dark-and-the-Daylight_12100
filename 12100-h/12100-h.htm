<h3>I</h3>

<p>Matthew Lanfear had stopped off, between Genoa and Nice, at San Remo
in the interest of a friend who had come over on the steamer with him,
and who wished him to test the air before settling there for the winter
with an invalid wife. She was one of those neurasthenics who really
carry their climate&#8212;always a bad one&#8212;with them, but she had
set her mind on San Remo; and Lanfear was willing to pass a few days in
the place making the observations which he felt pretty sure would be
adverse.</p>

<p>His train was rather late, and the sunset was fading from the French
sky beyond the Italian shore when he got out of his car and looked round
for a porter to take his valise. His roving eye lighted on the anxious
figure, which as fully as the anxious face, of a short, stout, elderly
man expressed a sort of distraction, as he stood loaded down with
umbrellas, bags, bundles, and wraps, and seemed unable to arrest the
movements of a tall young girl, with a travelling-shawl trailing from
her arm, who had the effect of escaping from him towards a bench beside
the door of the waiting-room. When she reached it, in spite of his
appeals, she sat down with an absent air, and looked as far withdrawn
from the bustle of the platform and from the snuffling train as if on
some quiet garden seat along with her own thoughts.</p>

<p>In his fat frenzy, which Lanfear felt to be pathetic, the old
gentleman glanced at him, and then abruptly demanded: &#8220;Are you an
American?&#8221;</p>

<p>We knew each other abroad in some mystical way, and Lanfear did not
try to deny the fact.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, well, then,&#8221; the stranger said, as if the fact made
everything right, &#8220;will you kindly tell my daughter, on that bench
by the door yonder&#8221;&#8212;he pointed with a bag, and dropped a
roll of rugs from under his arm&#8212;&#8220;that I&#8217;ll be with her
as soon as I&#8217;ve looked after the trunks? Tell her not to move till
I come. Heigh! Here! Take hold of these, will you?&#8221; He caught the
sleeve of a <em>facchino</em> who came wandering by, and heaped him with
his burdens, and then pushed ahead of the man in the direction of the
baggage-room with a sort of mastery of the situation which struck
Lanfear as springing from desperation rather than experience.</p>

<p>Lanfear stood a moment hesitating. Then a glance at the girl on the
bench, drooping a little forward in freeing her face from the veil that
hung from her pretty hat, together with a sense of something quaintly
charming in the confidence shown him on such purely compatriotic
grounds, decided him to do just what he had been asked. The girl had got
her veil up by this time, and as he came near, she turned from looking
at the sunset over the stretch of wall beyond the halting train, and met
his dubious face with a smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;It <em>is</em> beautiful, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; she said.
&#8220;I know I shall get well, here, if they have such sunsets every
day.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was something so convincingly normal in her expression that
Lanfear dismissed a painful conjecture. &#8220;I beg your pardon,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;I am afraid there&#8217;s some mistake. I haven&#8217;t
the pleasure&#8212;You must excuse me, but your father wished me to ask
you to wait here for him till he had got his baggage&#8212;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My father?&#8221; the girl stopped him with a sort of a
frowning perplexity in the stare she gave him. &#8220;My father
isn&#8217;t here!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I beg your pardon,&#8221; Lanfear said. &#8220;I must have
misunderstood. A gentleman who got out of the train with you&#8212;a
short, stout gentleman with gray hair&#8212;I understood him to say you
were his daughter&#8212;requested me to bring this
message&#8212;&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl shook her head. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know him. It must be a
mistake.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The mistake is mine, no doubt. It may have been some one else
whom he pointed out, and I have blundered. I&#8217;m very sorry if I
seem to have intruded&#8212;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What place is this?&#8221; the girl asked, without noticing
his excuses.</p>

<p>&#8220;San Remo,&#8221; Lanfear answered. &#8220;If you didn&#8217;t
intend to stop here, your train will be leaving in a moment.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I meant to get off, I suppose,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t believe I&#8217;m going any farther.&#8221; She leaned back
against the bars of the bench, and put up one of her slim arms along the
top.</p>

<p>There was something wrong. Lanfear now felt that, in spite of her
perfect tranquillity and self-possession; perhaps because of it. He had
no business to stay there talking with her, but he had not quite the
right to leave her, though practically he had got his dismissal, and
apparently she was quite capable of taking care of herself, or could
have been so in a country where any woman&#8217;s defencelessness was
not any man&#8217;s advantage. He could not go away without some effort
to be of use.</p>

<p>&#8220;I beg your pardon,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Can I help you in
calling a carriage; or looking after your hand-baggage&#8212;it will be
getting dark&#8212;perhaps your maid&#8212;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My <em>maid!</em>&#8221; The girl frowned again, with a
measure of the amazement which she showed when he mentioned her father.
&#8220;<em>I</em> have no maid!&#8221;</p>

<p>Lanfear blurted desperately out: &#8220;You are alone? You
came&#8212;you are going to stay here&#8212;alone?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite alone,&#8221; she said, with a passivity in which there
was no resentment, and no feeling unless it were a certain color of
dignity. Almost at the same time, with a glance beside and beyond him,
she called out joyfully: &#8220;Ah, there you are!&#8221; and Lanfear
turned, and saw scuffling and heard puffing towards them the short,
stout elderly gentleman who had sent him to her. &#8220;I knew you would
come before long!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I thought it was pretty long, myself,&#8221; the
gentleman said, and then he courteously referred himself to Lanfear.
&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid this gentleman has found it rather long, too;
but I couldn&#8217;t manage it a moment sooner.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lanfear said: &#8220;Not at all. I wish I could have been of any use
to&#8212;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My daughter&#8212;Miss Gerald, Mr.&#8212;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lanfear&#8212;Dr. Lanfear,&#8221; he said, accepting the
introduction; and the girl bowed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, doctor, eh?&#8221; the father said, with a certain
impression. &#8220;Going to stop here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A few days,&#8221; Lanfear answered, making way for the
forward movement which the others began.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, well! I&#8217;m very much obliged to you, very much,
indeed; and I&#8217;m sure my daughter is.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl said, &#8220;Oh yes, indeed,&#8221; rather indifferently,
and then as they passed him, while he stood lifting his hat, she turned
radiantly on him. &#8220;Thank you, ever so much!&#8221; she said, with
the gentle voice which he had already thought charming.</p>

<p>The father called back: &#8220;I hope we shall meet again. We are
going to the Sardegna.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lanfear had been going to the Sardegna himself, but while he bowed he
now decided upon another hotel.</p>

<p>The mystery, whatever it was, that the brave, little, fat father was
carrying off so bluffly, had clearly the morbid quality of unhealth in
it, and Lanfear could not give himself freely to a young pleasure in the
girl&#8217;s dark beauty of eyes and hair, her pale, irregular, piquant
face, her slender figure and flowing walk. He was in the presence of
something else, something that appealed to his scientific side, to that
which was humane more than that which was human in him, and abashed him
in the other feeling. Unless she was out of her mind there was no way of
accounting for her behavior, except by some caprice which was itself
scarcely short of insanity. She must have thought she knew him when he
approached, and when she addressed him those first words; but when he
had tried to set her right she had not changed; and why had she denied
her father, and then hailed him with joy when he came back to her? She
had known that she intended to stop at San Remo, but she had not known
where she had stopped when she asked what place it was. She was
consciously an invalid of some sort, for she spoke of getting well under
sunsets like that which had now waned, but what sort of invalid was
she?</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>Lanfear&#8217;s question persisted through the night, and it helped,
with the coughing in the next room, to make a bad night for him. None of
the hotels in San Remo receive consumptive patients, but none are
without somewhere a bronchial cough. If it is in the room next yours it
keeps you awake, but it is not pulmonary; you may comfort yourself in
your vigils with that fact. Lanfear, however, fancied he had got a poor
dinner, and in the morning he did not like his coffee. He thought he had
let a foolish scruple keep him from the Grand Hotel Sardegna, and he
walked down towards it along the palm-flanked promenade, in the gay
morning light, with the tideless sea on the other hand lapping the rough
beach beyond the lines of the railroad which borders it. On his way he
met files of the beautiful Ligurian women, moving straight under the
burdens balanced on their heads, or bestriding the donkeys laden with
wine-casks in the roadway, or following beside the carts which the
donkeys drew. Ladies of all nations, in the summer fashions of London,
Berlin, St. Petersburg, Paris, and New York thronged the path. The sky
was of a blue so deep, so liquid that it seemed to him he could scoop it
in his hand and pour it out again like water. Seaward, he glanced at the
fishing-boats lying motionless in the offing, and the coastwise steamer
that runs between Nice and Genoa trailing a thin plume of smoke between
him and their white sails. With the more definite purpose of making sure
of the Grand Hotel Sardegna, he scanned the different villa slopes that
showed their level lines of white and yellow and dull pink through the
gray tropical greenery on the different levels of the hills. He was duly
rewarded by the sight of the bold legend topping its cornice, and when
he let his eye descend the garden to a little pavilion on the wall
overlooking the road, he saw his acquaintances of the evening before
making a belated breakfast. The father recognized Lanfear first and
spoke to his daughter, who looked up from her coffee and down towards
him where he wavered, lifting his hat, and bowed smiling to him. He had
no reason to cross the roadway towards the white stairway which climbed
from it to the hotel grounds, but he did so. The father leaned out over
the wall, and called down to him: &#8220;Won&#8217;t you come up and
join us, doctor?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, yes!&#8221; Lanfear consented, and in another moment he
was shaking hands with the girl, to whom, he noticed, her father named
him again. He had in his glad sense of her white morning dress and her
hat of green-leafed lace, a feeling that she was somehow meeting him as
a friend of indefinite date in an intimacy unconditioned by any past or
future time. Her pleasure in his being there was as frank as her
father&#8217;s, and there was a pretty trust of him in every word and
tone which forbade misinterpretation.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was just talking about you, doctor,&#8221; the father began,
&#8220;and saying what a pity you hadn&#8217;t come to our hotel.
It&#8217;s a capital place.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<em>I&#8217;ve</em> been thinking it was a pity I went to
mine,&#8221; Lanfear returned, &#8220;though I&#8217;m in San Remo for
such a short time it&#8217;s scarcely worth while to change.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, perhaps if you came here, you might stay longer. I guess
we&#8217;re booked for the winter, Nannie?&#8221; He referred the
question to his daughter, who asked Lanfear if he would not have some
coffee.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was going to say I had had my coffee, but I&#8217;m not sure
it <em>was</em> coffee,&#8221; Lanfear began, and he consented, with
some demur, banal enough, about the trouble.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s right, then, and no trouble at all,&#8221;
Mr. Gerald broke in upon him. &#8220;Here comes a fellow looking for a
chance to bring you some,&#8221; and he called to a waiter wandering
distractedly about with a &#8220;Heigh!&#8221; that might have been
offensive from a less obviously inoffensive man. &#8220;Can you get our
friend here a cup and saucer, and some of this good coffee?&#8221; he
asked, as the waiter approached.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, certainly, sir,&#8221; the man answered in careful
English. &#8220;Is it not, perhaps, Mr. and Misses Gerald?&#8221; he
smilingly insinuated, offering some cards.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Gerald,&#8221; the father corrected him as he took the
cards. &#8220;Why, hello, Nannie! Here are the Bells! Where are
they?&#8221; he demanded of the waiter. &#8220;Bring them here, and a
lot more cups and saucers. Or, hold on! I&#8217;d better go myself,
Nannie, hadn&#8217;t I? Of course! You get the crockery, waiter. Where
did you say they were?&#8221; He bustled up from his chair, without
waiting for a distinct reply, and apologized to Lanfear in hurrying
away. &#8220;You&#8217;ll excuse me, doctor! I&#8217;ll be back in half
a minute. Friends of ours that came over on the same boat. I must see
them, of course, but I don&#8217;t believe they&#8217;ll stay. Nannie,
don&#8217;t let Dr. Lanfear get away. I want to have some talk with him.
You tell him he&#8217;d better come to the Sardegna, here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lanfear and Miss Gerald sat a moment in the silence which is apt to
follow with young people when they are unexpectedly left to themselves.
She kept absently pushing the cards her father had given her up and down
on the table between her thumb and forefinger, and Lanfear noted the
translucence of her long, thin hand in the sunshine striking across the
painted iron surface of the garden movable. The translucence had a
pathos for his intelligence which the pensive tilt of her head enhanced.
She stopped toying with the cards, and looked at the addresses on
them.</p>

<p>&#8220;What strange things names are!&#8221; she said, as if musing
on the fact, with a sigh which he thought disproportioned to the depth
of her remark.</p>

<p>&#8220;They seem rather irrelevant at times,&#8221; he admitted, with
a smile. &#8220;They&#8217;re mere tags, labels, which can be attached
to one as well as another; they seem to belong equally to
anybody.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is what I always say to myself,&#8221; she agreed, with
more interest than he found explicable.</p>

<p>&#8220;But finally,&#8221; he returned, &#8220;they&#8217;re all
that&#8217;s left us, if they&#8217;re left themselves. They are the
only signs to the few who knew us that we ever existed. They stand for
our characters, our personality, our mind, our soul.&#8221;</p>

<p>She said, &#8220;That is very true,&#8221; and then she suddenly gave
him the cards. &#8220;Do you know these people?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I? I thought they were friends of yours,&#8221; he replied,
astonished.</p>

<div class="illustration"><a href="images/illust2l.jpg" name="illust2"><img src="images/illust2m.jpg" title="A LIVELY MATRON, OF AS YOUTHFUL A TEMPERAMENT AS THE LIVELY GIRLS SHE BROUGHT IN HER TRAIN, BURST UPON THEM" alt="[Illustration: A LIVELY MATRON, OF AS YOUTHFUL A TEMPERAMENT AS THE LIVELY GIRLS SHE BROUGHT IN HER TRAIN, BURST UPON THEM]" style="width: 450px; height: 723px" /></a></div>

<p>&#8220;That is what papa thinks,&#8221; Miss Gerald said, and while
she sat dreamily absent, a rustle of skirts and a flutter of voices
pierced from the surrounding shrubbery, and then a lively matron, of as
youthful a temperament as the lively girls she brought in her train,
burst upon them, and Miss Gerald was passed from one embrace to another
until all four had kissed her. She returned their greeting, and shared,
in her quieter way, their raptures at their encounter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Such a hunt as we&#8217;ve had for you!&#8221; the matron
shouted. &#8220;We&#8217;ve been up-stairs and down-stairs and in my
lady&#8217;s chamber, all over the hotel. Where&#8217;s your father? Ah,
they did get our cards to you!&#8221; and by that token Lanfear knew
that these ladies were the Bells. He had stood up in a sort of
expectancy, but Miss Gerald did not introduce him, and a shadow of
embarrassment passed over the party which she seemed to feel least,
though he fancied a sort of entreaty in the glance that she let pass
over him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose he&#8217;s gone to look for <em>us!</em>&#8221; Mrs.
Bell saved the situation with a protecting laugh. Miss Gerald colored
intelligently, and Lanfear could not let Mrs. Bell&#8217;s implication
pass.</p>

<p>&#8220;If it is Mrs. Bell,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I can answer that
he has. I met you at Magnolia some years ago, Mrs. Bell. Dr.
Lanfear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I beg your pardon, Dr. Lanfear,&#8221; Miss Gerald said.
&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t think&#8212;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of my tag, my label?&#8221; he laughed back. &#8220;It
isn&#8217;t very distinctly lettered.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Bell was not much minding them jointly. She was singling Lanfear
out for the expression of her pleasure in seeing him again, and
recalling the incidents of her summer at Magnolia before, it seemed, any
of her girls were out. She presented them collectively, and the eldest
of them charmingly reminded Lanfear that he had once had the magnanimity
to dance with her when she sat, in a little girl&#8217;s forlorn despair
of being danced with, at one of those desolate hops of the good old
Osprey House.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; and now,&#8221; her mother followed, &#8220;we
can&#8217;t wait a moment longer, if we&#8217;re to get our train for
Monte Carlo, girls. We&#8217;re not going to play, doctor,&#8221; she
made time to explain, &#8220;but we are going to look on. Will you tell
your father, dear,&#8221; she said, taking the girl&#8217;s hands
caressingly in hers, and drawing her to her motherly bosom, &#8220;that
we found you, and did our best to find him? We can&#8217;t wait
now&#8212;our carriage is champing the bit at the foot of the
stairs&#8212;but we&#8217;re coming back in a week, and then we&#8217;ll
do our best to look you up again.&#8221; She included Lanfear in her
good-bye, and all her girls said good-bye in the same way, and with a
whisking of skirts and twitter of voices they vanished through the
shrubbery, and faded into the general silence and general sound like a
bevy of birds which had swept near and passed by.</p>

<p>Miss Gerald sank quietly into her place, and sat as if nothing had
happened, except that she looked a little paler to Lanfear, who remained
on foot trying to piece together their interrupted t&#234;te-&#224;-t&#234;te, but not
succeeding, when her father reappeared, red and breathless, and wiping
his forehead. &#8220;Have they been here, Nannie?&#8221; he asked.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve been following them all over the place, and the
<i>portier</i> told me just now that he had seen a party of ladies coming
down this way.&#8221;</p>

<p>He got it all out, not so clearly as those women had got everything
in, Lanfear reflected, but unmistakably enough as to the fact, and he
looked at his daughter as he repeated: &#8220;Haven&#8217;t the Bells
been here?&#8221;</p>

<div class="illustration"><a href="images/illust3l.jpg" name="illust3"><img src="images/illust3m.jpg" title="&#8220;SHE SHOOK HER HEAD, AND SAID,... &#8216;NOBODY HAS BEEN HERE, EXCEPT&#8212;&#8217;&#8221;" alt="[Illustration: &#8220;SHE SHOOK HER HEAD, AND SAID,... &#8216;NOBODY HAS BEEN HERE, EXCEPT&#8212;&#8217;&#8221;]" style="width: 599px; height: 450px" /></a></div>

<p>She shook her head, and said, with her delicate quiet: &#8220;Nobody
has been here, except&#8212;&#8221; She glanced at Lanfear, who smiled,
but saw no opening for himself in the strange situation. Then she said:
&#8220;I think I will go and lie down a while, now, papa. I&#8217;m
rather tired. Good-bye,&#8221; she said, giving Lanfear her hand; it
felt limp and cold; and then she turned to her father again.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t you come, papa! I can get back perfectly well by
myself. Stay with&#8212;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will go with you,&#8221; her father said, &#8220;and if Dr.
Lanfear doesn&#8217;t mind coming&#8212;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly I will come,&#8221; Lanfear said, and he passed to
the girl&#8217;s right; she had taken her father&#8217;s arm; but he
wished to offer more support if it were needed. When they had climbed to
the open flowery space before the hotel, she seemed aware of the groups
of people about. She took her hand from her father&#8217;s arm, as if
unwilling to attract their notice by seeming to need its help, and swept
up the gravelled path between him and Lanfear, with her flowing
walk.</p>

<p>Her father fell back, as they entered the hotel door, and murmured to
Lanfear: &#8220;Will you wait till I come down?&#8221; ... &#8220;I
wanted to tell you about my daughter,&#8221; he explained, when he came
back after the quarter of an hour which Lanfear had found rather
intense. &#8220;It&#8217;s useless to pretend you wouldn&#8217;t have
noticed&#8212;Had nobody been with you after I left you, down
there?&#8221; He twisted his head in the direction of the pavilion,
where they had been breakfasting.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; Mrs. Bell and her daughters,&#8221; Lanfear answered,
simply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course! Why do you suppose my daughter denied it?&#8221;
Mr. Gerald asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose she&#8212;had her reasons,&#8221; Lanfear answered,
lamely enough.</p>

<p>&#8220;No <em>reason</em>, I&#8217;m afraid,&#8221; Mr. Gerald said,
and he broke out hopelessly: &#8220;She has her mind sound enough, but
not&#8212;not her memory. She had forgotten that they were there! Are
you going to stay in San Remo?&#8221; he asked, with an effect of
interrupting himself, as if in the wish to put off something, or to make
the ground sure before he went on.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; Lanfear said, &#8220;I hadn&#8217;t thought of it.
I stopped&#8212;I was going to Nice&#8212;to test the air for a friend
who wishes to bring his invalid wife here, if I approve&#8212;but I have
just been asking myself why I should go to Nice when I could stay at San
Remo. The place takes my fancy. I&#8217;m something of an invalid
myself&#8212;at least I&#8217;m on my vacation&#8212;and I find a charm
in it, if nothing better. Perhaps a charm is enough. It used to be, in
primitive medicine.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was talking to what he felt was not an undivided attention in Mr.
Gerald, who said, &#8220;I&#8217;m glad of it,&#8221; and then added:
&#8220;I should like to consult you professionally. I know your
reputation in New York&#8212;though I&#8217;m not a New-Yorker
myself&#8212;and I don&#8217;t know any of the doctors here. I suppose
I&#8217;ve done rather a wild thing in coming off the way I have, with
my daughter; but I felt that I must do something, and I hoped&#8212;I
felt as if it were getting away from our trouble. It&#8217;s most
fortunate my meeting you, if you can look into the case, and help me out
with a nurse, if she&#8217;s needed, and all that!&#8221; To a certain
hesitation in Lanfear&#8217;s face, he added: &#8220;Of course,
I&#8217;m asking your professional help. My name is Abner
Gerald&#8212;Abner L. Gerald&#8212;perhaps you know my standing, and
that I&#8217;m able to&#8212;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it isn&#8217;t a question of that! I shall be glad to do
anything I can,&#8221; Lanfear said, with a little pang which he tried
to keep silent in orienting himself anew towards the girl, whose
loveliness he had felt before he had felt her piteousness.</p>

<p>&#8220;But before you go further I ought to say that you must have
been thinking of my uncle, the first Matthew Lanfear, when you spoke of
my reputation; I haven&#8217;t got any yet; I&#8217;ve only got my
uncle&#8217;s name.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; Mr. Gerald said, disappointedly, but after a blank
moment he apparently took courage. &#8220;You&#8217;re in the same line,
though?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you mean the psychopathic line, without being exactly an
alienist, well, yes,&#8221; Lanfear admitted.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s exactly what I mean,&#8221; the elder said, with
renewed hopefulness. &#8220;I&#8217;m quite willing to risk myself with
a man of the same name as Dr. Lanfear. I should like,&#8221; he said,
hurrying on, as if to override any further reluctance of
Lanfear&#8217;s, &#8220;to tell you her story, and
then&#8212;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By all means,&#8221; Lanfear consented, and he put on an air
of professional deference, while the older man began with a face set for
the task.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a long story, or it&#8217;s a short story, as you
choose to make it. We&#8217;ll make it long, if necessary, later, but
now I&#8217;ll make it short. Five months ago my wife was killed before
my daughter&#8217;s eyes&#8212;&#8221;</p>

<p>He stopped; Lanfear breathed a gentle &#8220;Oh!&#8221; and Gerald
blurted out:</p>

<p>&#8220;Accident&#8212;grade crossing&#8212;Don&#8217;t!&#8221; he
winced at the kindness in Lanfear&#8217;s eyes, and panted on.
&#8220;That&#8217;s over! What happened to <em>her</em>&#8212;to my
daughter&#8212;was that she fainted from the shock. When she
woke&#8212;it was more like a sleep than a swoon&#8212;she didn&#8217;t
remember what had happened.&#8221; Lanfear nodded, with a gravely
interested face. &#8220;She didn&#8217;t remember anything that had ever
happened before. She knew me, because I was there with her; but she
didn&#8217;t know that she ever had a mother, because she was not there
with her. You see?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can imagine,&#8221; Lanfear assented.</p>

<p>&#8220;The whole of her life before the&#8212;accident was wiped out
as to the facts, as completely as if it had never been; and now every
day, every hour, every minute, as it passes, goes with that past. But
her faculties&#8212;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221; Lanfear prompted in the pause which Mr. Gerald
made.</p>

<p>&#8220;Her intellect&#8212;the working powers of her mind, apart from
anything like remembering, are as perfect as if she were in full
possession of her memory. I believe,&#8221; the father said, with a
pride that had its pathos, &#8220;no one can talk with her and not feel
that she has a beautiful mind, that she can think better than most girls
of her age. She reads, or she lets me read to her, and until it has time
to fade, she appreciates it all more fully than I do. At Genoa, where I
took her to the palaces for the pictures, I saw that she had kept her
feeling for art. When she plays&#8212;you will hear her play&#8212;it is
like composing the music for herself; she does not seem to remember the
pieces, she seems to improvise them. You understand?&#8221;</p>

<p>Lanfear said that he understood, for he could not disappoint the
expectation of the father&#8217;s boastful love: all that was left him
of the ambitions he must once have had for his child.</p>

<p>The poor, little, stout, unpicturesque elderly man got up and began
to walk to and fro in the room which he had turned into with Lanfear,
and to say, more to himself than to Lanfear, as if balancing one thing
against another: &#8220;The merciful thing is that she has been saved
from the horror and the sorrow. She knows no more of either than she
knows of her mother&#8217;s love for her. They were very much alike in
looks and mind, and they were always together more like persons of the
same age&#8212;sisters, or girl friends; but she has lost all knowledge
of that, as of other things. And then there is the question whether she
won&#8217;t some time, sooner or later, come into both the horror and
the sorrow.&#8221; He stopped and looked at Lanfear. &#8220;She has
these sudden fits of drowsiness, when she <em>must</em> sleep; and I
never see her wake from them without being afraid that she has wakened
to everything&#8212;that she has got back into her full self, and taken
up the terrible burden that my old shoulders are used to. What do you
think?&#8221;</p>

<p>Lanfear felt the appeal so keenly that in the effort to answer
faithfully he was aware of being harsher than he meant. &#8220;That is a
chance we can&#8217;t forecast. But it is a chance. The fact that the
drowsiness recurs periodically&#8212;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t,&#8221; the father pleaded. &#8220;We
don&#8217;t know when it will come on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It scarcely matters. The periodicity wouldn&#8217;t affect the
possible result which you dread. I don&#8217;t say that it is probable.
But it&#8217;s one of the possibilities. It has,&#8221; Lanfear added,
&#8220;its logic.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, its logic!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Its logic, yes. My business, of course, would be to restore
her to health at any risk. So far as her mind is
affected&#8212;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Her mind is not affected!&#8221; the father retorted.</p>

<p>&#8220;I beg your pardon&#8212;her memory&#8212;it might be restored
with her physical health. You understand that? It is a chance; it might
or it might not happen.&#8221;</p>

<p>The father was apparently facing a risk which he had not squarely
faced before. &#8220;I suppose so,&#8221; he faltered. After a moment he
added, with more courage: &#8220;You must do the best you can, at any
risk.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lanfear rose, too. He said, with returning kindness in his tones, if
not his words: &#8220;I should like to study the case, Mr. Gerald.
It&#8217;s very interesting, and&#8212;and&#8212;if you&#8217;ll forgive
me&#8212;very touching.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you decide to stay in San Remo, I will&#8212;Do you
suppose I could get a room in this hotel? I don&#8217;t like
mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, I haven&#8217;t any doubt you can. Shall we
ask?&#8221;</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>It was from the Hotel Sardegna that Lanfear satisfied his conscience
by pushing his search for climate on behalf of his friend&#8217;s
neurasthenic wife. He decided that Ospedaletti, with a milder air and
more sheltered seat in its valley of palms, would be better for her than
San Remo. He wrote his friend to that effect, and then there was no
preoccupation to hinder him in his devotion to the case of Miss Gerald.
He put the case first in the order of interest rather purposely, and
even with a sense of effort, though he could not deny to himself that a
like case related to a different personality might have been less
absorbing. But he tried to keep his scientific duty to it pure of that
certain painful pleasure which, as a young man not much over thirty, he
must feel in the strange affliction of a young and beautiful girl.</p>

<p>Though there was no present question of medicine, he could be
installed near her, as the friend that her father insisted upon making
him, without contravention of the social formalities. His care of her
hardly differed from that of her father, except that it involved a
closer and more premeditated study. They did not try to keep her from
the sort of association which, in a large hotel of the type of the
Sardegna, entails no sort of obligation to intimacy. They sat together
at the long table, midway of the dining-room, which maintained the
tradition of the old table-d&#8217;h&#244;te against the small tables ranged
along the walls. Gerald had an amiable old man&#8217;s liking for talk,
and Lanfear saw that he willingly escaped, among their changing
companions, from the pressure of his anxieties. He left his daughter
very much to Lanfear, during these excursions, but Lanfear was far from
meaning to keep her to himself. He thought it better that she should
follow her father in his forays among their neighbors, and he encouraged
her to continue such talk with them as she might be brought into. He
tried to guard her future encounters with them, so that she should not
show more than a young girl&#8217;s usual diffidence at a second
meeting; and in the frequent substitution of one presence for another
across the table, she was fairly safe.</p>

<p>A natural light-heartedness, of which he had glimpses from the first,
returned to her. One night, at the dance given by some of the guests to
some others, she went through the gayety in joyous triumph. She danced
mostly with Lanfear, but she had other partners, and she won a pleasing
popularity by the American quality of her waltzing. Lanfear had already
noted that her forgetfulness was not always so constant or so inclusive
as her father had taught him to expect; Mr. Gerald&#8217;s statement had
been the large, general fact from which there was sometimes a shrinking
in the particulars. While the warmth of an agreeable experience lasted,
her mind kept record of it, slight or full; if the experience were
unpleasant the memory was more apt to fade at once. After that dance she
repeated to her father the little compliments paid her, and told him,
laughing, they were to reward him for sitting up so late as her
chaperon. Emotions persisted in her consciousness as the tremor lasts in
a smitten cord, but events left little trace. She retained a sense of
personalities; she was lastingly sensible of temperaments; but names
were nothing to her. She could not tell her father who had said the nice
things to her, and <a name="illust1ref" id="illust1ref">their joint study of her
dancing-card did not help them out</a>.</p>

<p>Her relation to Lanfear, though it might be a subject of
international scrutiny, was hardly a subject of censure. He was known as
Dr. Lanfear, but he was not at first known as her physician; he was
conjectured her cousin or something like that; he might even be her
betrothed in the peculiar American arrangement of such affairs.
Personally people saw in him a serious-looking young man, better dressed
and better mannered than they thought most Americans, and unquestionably
handsomer, with his Spanish skin and eyes, and his brown beard of the
Vandyke cut which was then already beginning to be rather belated.</p>

<p>Other Americans in the hotel were few and transitory; and if the
English had any mind about Miss Gerald different from their mind about
other girls, it would be perhaps to the effect that she was quite mad;
by this they would mean that she was a little odd; but for the rest they
had apparently no mind about her. With the help of one of the English
ladies her father had replaced the homesick Irish maid whom he had sent
back to New York from Genoa, with an Italian, and in the shelter of her
gay affection and ignorant sympathy Miss Gerald had a security
supplemented by the easy social environment. If she did not look very
well, she did not differ from most other American women in that; and if
she seemed to confide herself more severely to the safe-keeping of her
physician, that was the way of all women patients.</p>

<p>Whether the Bells found the spectacle of depravity at Monte Carlo
more attractive than the smiling face of nature at San Remo or not, they
did not return, but sent for their baggage from their hotel, and were
not seen again by the Geralds. Lanfear&#8217;s friend with the invalid
wife wrote from Ospedaletti, with apologies which inculpated him for the
disappointment, that she had found the air impossible in a single day,
and they were off for Cannes. Lanfear and the Geralds, therefore,
continued together in the hotel without fear or obligation to others,
and in an immunity in which their right to breakfast exclusively in that
pavilion on the garden wall was almost explicitly conceded. No one,
after a few mornings of tacit possession, would have disputed their
claim, and there, day after day, in the mild monotony of the December
sunshine, they sat and drank their coffee, and talked of the sights
which the peasants in the street, and the tourists in the promenade
beyond it, afforded. The rows of stumpy palms which separated the road
from the walk were not so high but that they had the whole lift of the
sea to the horizon where it lost itself in a sky that curved blue as
turquoise to the zenith overhead. The sun rose from its morning bath on
the left, and sank to its evening bath on the right, and in making its
climb of the spacious arc between, shed a heat as great as that of
summer, but not the heat of summer, on the pretty world of villas and
hotels, towered over by the olive-gray slopes of the pine-clad heights
behind and above them. From these tops a fine, keen cold fell with the
waning afternoon, which sharpened through the sunset till the dusk; but
in the morning the change was from the chill to the glow, and they could
sit in their pavilion, under the willowy droop of the eucalyptus-trees
which have brought the Southern Pacific to the Riviera, with increasing
comfort.</p>

<p>In the restlessness of an elderly man, Gerald sometimes left the
young people to their intolerable delays over their coffee, and walked
off into the little stone and stucco city below, or went and sat with
his cigar on one of the benches under the palm-lined promenade, which
the pale northern consumptives shared with the swarthy peasant girls
resting from their burdens, and the wrinkled grandmothers of their race
passively or actively begging from the strangers.</p>

<p>While she kept her father in sight it seemed that Miss Gerald could
maintain her hold of his identity, and one morning she said, with the
tender fondness for him which touched Lanfear: &#8220;When he sits there
among those sick people and poor people, then he knows they are in the
world.&#8221;</p>

<p>She turned with a question graver in her look than usual, and he
said: &#8220;Yes, we might help them oftener if we could remember that
their misery was going on all the time, like some great natural process,
day or dark, heat or cold, which seems to stop when we stop thinking of
it. Nothing, for us, at least, exists unless it is recalled to
us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said, in her turn, &#8220;I have noticed that.
But don&#8217;t you sometimes&#8212;sometimes&#8221;&#8212;she knit her
forehead, as if to keep her thought from escaping&#8212;&#8220;have a
feeling as if what you were doing, or saying, or seeing, had all
happened before, just as it is now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh yes; that occurs to every one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But don&#8217;t you&#8212;don&#8217;t you have hints of
things, of ideas, as if you had known them, in some previous
existence&#8212;&#8221;</p>

<p>She stopped, and Lanfear recognized, with a kind of impatience, the
experience which young people make much of when they have it, and
sometimes pretend to when they have merely heard of it. But there could
be no pose or pretence in her. He smilingly suggested:</p>

<p class="poetry">&#8220;&#8216;For something is, or something seems,
<br />Like glimpses of forgotten dreams.&#8217;</p>

<p style="text-indent: 0em">These weird impressions are no more than
that, probably.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, I don&#8217;t believe it,&#8221; the girl said.
&#8220;They are too real for that. They come too often, and they make me
feel as if they would come more fully, some time. If there was a life
before this&#8212;do you believe there was?&#8212;they may be things
that happened there. Or they may be things that will happen in a life
after this. You believe in <em>that</em>, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In a life after this, or their happening in it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, both.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lanfear evaded her, partly. &#8220;They could be premonitions,
prophecies, of a future life, as easily as fragmentary records of a past
life. I suppose we do not begin to be immortal merely after
death.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221; She lingered out the word in dreamy absence, as if
what they had been saying had already passed from her thought.</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Miss Gerald,&#8221; Lanfear ventured, &#8220;have these
impressions of yours grown more definite&#8212;fuller, as you
say&#8212;of late?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My impressions?&#8221; She frowned at him, as if the look of
interest, more intense than usual in his eyes, annoyed her. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t know what you mean.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lanfear felt bound to follow up her lead, whether she wished it or
not. &#8220;A good third of our lives here is passed in sleep. I&#8217;m
not always sure that we are right in treating the mental&#8212;for
certainly they are mental&#8212;experiences of that time as altogether
trivial, or insignificant.&#8221;</p>

<p>She seemed to understand now, and she protested: &#8220;But I
don&#8217;t mean dreams. I mean things that really happened, or that
really will happen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Like something you can give me an instance of? Are they
painful things, or pleasant, mostly?&#8221;</p>

<p>She hesitated. &#8220;They are things that you know happen to other
people, but you can&#8217;t believe would ever happen to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do they come when you are just drowsing, or just waking from a
drowse?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They are not dreams,&#8221; she said, almost with
vexation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes, I understand,&#8221; he hesitated to retrieve
himself. &#8220;But <em>I</em> have had floating illusions, just before
I fell asleep, or when I was sensible of not being quite awake, which
seemed to differ from dreams. They were not so dramatic, but they were
more pictorial; they were more visual than the things in
dreams.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she assented. &#8220;They are something like that.
But I should not call them illusions.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. And they represent scenes, events?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You said yourself they were not dramatic.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I meant, represent pictorially.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; they are like the landscape that flies back from your
train or towards it. I can&#8217;t explain it,&#8221; she ended, rising
with what he felt a displeasure in his pursuit.</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>He reported what had passed to her father when Mr. Gerald came back
from his stroll into the town, with his hands full of English papers;
Gerald had even found a New York paper at the news-stand; and he
listened with an apparent postponement of interest.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; Lanfear said, &#8220;that she has some shadowy
recollection, or rather that the facts come to her in a jarred, confused
way&#8212;the elements of pictures, not pictures. But I am afraid that
my inquiry has offended her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess not,&#8221; Gerald said, dryly, as if annoyed.
&#8220;What makes you think so?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Merely her manner. And I don&#8217;t know that anything is to
be gained by such an inquiry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps not,&#8221; Gerald allowed, with an inattention which
vexed Lanfear in his turn.</p>

<p>The elderly man looked up, from where he sat provisionally in the
hotel veranda, into Lanfear&#8217;s face; Lanfear had remained standing.
&#8220;<em>I</em> don&#8217;t believe she&#8217;s offended. Or she
won&#8217;t be long. One thing, she&#8217;ll forget it.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was right enough, apparently. Miss Gerald came out of the hotel
door towards them, smiling equally for both, with the indefinable
difference between cognition and recognition habitual in her look. She
was dressed for a walk, and she seemed to expect them to go with her.
She beamed gently upon Lanfear; there was no trace of umbrage in her
sunny gayety. Her face had, as always, its lurking pathos, but in its
appeal to Lanfear now there were only trust and the wish of pleasing
him.</p>

<p>They started side by side for their walk, while her father drove
beside them in one of the little public carriages, mounting to the
Berigo Road, through a street of the older San Remo, and issuing on a
bare little piazza looking towards the walls and roofs of the mediaeval
city, clustered together like cliff-dwellings, and down on the gardens
that fell from the villas and the hotels. A parapet kept the path on the
roadside nearest the declivities, and from point to point benches were
put for the convenient enjoyment of the prospect. Mr. Gerald preferred
to take his pleasure from the greater elevation of the seat in his
victoria; his daughter and Lanfear leaned on the wall, and looked up to
the sky and out to the sea, both of the same blue.</p>

<p>The palms and eucalyptus-trees darkened about the villas; the bits of
vineyard, in their lingering crimson or lingering gold, and the orchards
of peaches and persimmons enriched with the varying reds of their
ripening leaves and fruits the enchanting color scheme. The rose and
geranium hedges were in bloom; the feathery green of the pepper-trees
was warmed by the red-purple of their grape-like clusters of blossoms;
the perfume of lemon flowers wandered vaguely upwards from some point
which they could not fix.</p>

<p>Nothing of all the beauty seemed lost upon the girl, so bereft that
she could enjoy no part of it from association. Lanfear observed that
she was not fatigued by any such effort as he was always helplessly
making to match what he saw with something he had seen before. Now, when
this effort betrayed itself, she said, smiling: &#8220;How strange it is
that you see things for what they are like, and not for what they
are!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s a defect, I&#8217;m afraid, sometimes.
Perhaps&#8212;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps what?&#8221; she prompted him in the pause he
made.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing. I was wondering whether in some other possible life
our consciousness would not be more independent of what we have been
than it seems to be here.&#8221; She looked askingly at him. &#8220;I
mean whether there shall not be something absolute in our existence,
whether it shall not realize itself more in each experience of the
moment, and not be always seeking to verify itself from the
past.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t that what you think is the way with me
already?&#8221; She turned upon him smiling, and he perceived that in
her New York version of a Parisian costume, with her lace hat of summer
make and texture and the vivid parasol she twirled upon her shoulder,
she was not only a very pretty girl, but a fashionable one. There was
something touching in the fact, and a little bewildering. To the pretty
girl, the fashionable girl, he could have answered with a joke, but the
stricken intelligence had a claim to his seriousness. Now, especially,
he noted what had from time to time urged itself upon his perception. If
the broken ties which once bound her to the past were beginning to knit
again, her recovery otherwise was not apparent. As she stood there her
beauty had signally the distinction of fragility, the delicacy of
shattered nerves in which there was yet no visible return to strength. A
feeling, which had intimated itself before, a sense as of being in the
presence of a disembodied spirit, possessed him, and brought, in its
contradiction of an accepted theory, a suggestion that was destined to
become conviction. He had always said to himself that there could be no
persistence of personality, of character, of identity, of consciousness,
except through memory; yet here, to the last implication of temperament,
they all persisted. The soul that was passing in its integrity through
time without the helps, the crutches, of remembrance by which his own
personality supported itself, why should not it pass so through eternity
without that loss of identity which was equivalent to annihilation?</p>

<p>Her waiting eyes recalled him from his inquiry, and with an effort he
answered, &#8220;Yes, I think you do have your being here and now, Miss
Gerald, to an unusual degree.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you don&#8217;t think that is wrong?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wrong? Why? How?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t know.&#8221; She looked round, and her eye
fell upon her father waiting for them in his carriage beside the walk.
The sight supplied her with the notion which Lanfear perceived would not
have occurred otherwise. &#8220;Then why doesn&#8217;t papa want me to
remember things?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; Lanfear temporized.
&#8220;Doesn&#8217;t he?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t always tell. Should&#8212;should <em>you</em>
wish me to remember more than I do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I?&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked at him with entreaty. &#8220;Do you think it would make my
father happier if I did?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That I can&#8217;t say,&#8221; Lanfear answered. &#8220;People
are often the sadder for what they remember. If I were your
father&#8212;Excuse me! I don&#8217;t mean anything so absurd. But in
his place&#8212;&#8221;</p>

<p>He stopped, and she said, as if she were satisfied with his broken
reply: &#8220;It is very curious. When I look at him&#8212;when I am
with him&#8212;I know him; but when he is away, I don&#8217;t remember
him.&#8221; She seemed rather interested in the fact than distressed by
it; she even smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;And me,&#8221; he ventured, &#8220;is it the same with regard
to me?&#8221;</p>

<p>She did not say; she asked, smiling: &#8220;Do you remember me when I
am away?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes!&#8221; he answered. &#8220;As perfectly as if you were
with me. I can see you, hear you, feel the touch of your hand, your
dress&#8212;Good heavens!&#8221; he added to himself under his breath.
&#8220;What am I saying to this poor child!&#8221;</p>

<p>In the instinct of escaping from himself he started forward, and she
moved with him. Mr. Gerald&#8217;s watchful driver followed them with
the carriage.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is very strange,&#8221; she said, lightly. &#8220;Is it
so with you about everyone?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he replied, briefly, almost harshly. He asked,
abruptly: &#8220;Miss Gerald, are there any times when you know people
in their absence?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just after I wake from a nap&#8212;yes. But it doesn&#8217;t
last. That is, it seems to me it doesn&#8217;t. I&#8217;m not
sure.&#8221;</p>

<p>As they followed the winding of the pleasant way, with the villas on
the slopes above and on the slopes below, she began to talk of them, and
to come into that knowledge of each which formed her remembrance of them
from former knowledge of them, but which he knew would fade when she
passed them.</p>

<p>The next morning, when she came down unwontedly late to breakfast in
their pavilion, she called gayly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Dr. Lanfear! It <em>is</em> Dr. Lanfear?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should be sorry if it were not, since you seem to expect it,
Miss Gerald.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I just wanted to be sure. Hasn&#8217;t my father been
here, yet?&#8221; It was the first time she had shown herself aware of
her father except in his presence, as it was the first time she had
named Lanfear to his face.</p>

<p>He suppressed a remote stir of anxiety, and answered: &#8220;He went
to get his newspapers; he wished you not to wait. I hope you slept
well?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Splendidly. But I was very tired last night; I don&#8217;t
know why, exactly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We had rather a long walk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did we have a walk yesterday?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then it was <em>so!</em> I thought I had dreamed it. I was
beginning to remember something, and my father asked me what it was, and
then I couldn&#8217;t remember. Do you believe I shall keep on
remembering?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see why you shouldn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Should you wish me to?&#8221; she asked, in evident, however
unconscious, recurrence to their talk of the day before.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>

<p>She sighed. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know. If it&#8217;s like some of
those dreams or gleams. Is remembering pleasant?&#8221;</p>

<p>Lanfear thought for a moment. Then he said, in the honesty he thought
best to use with her: &#8220;For the most part I should say it was
painful. Life is tolerable enough while it passes, but when it is past,
what remains seems mostly to hurt and humiliate. I don&#8217;t know why
we should remember so insistently the foolish things and wrong things we
do, and not recall the times when we acted, without an effort, wisely
and rightly.&#8221; He thought he had gone too far, and he hedged a
little. &#8220;I don&#8217;t mean that we <em>can&#8217;t</em> recall
those times. We can and do, to console and encourage ourselves; but they
don&#8217;t recur, without our willing, as the others do.&#8221;</p>

<p>She had poured herself a cup of coffee, and she played with the spoon
in her saucer while she seemed to listen. But she could not have been
listening, for when she put down her spoon and leaned back in her chair,
she said: &#8220;In those dreams the things come from such a very far
way back, and they don&#8217;t belong to a life that is like this. They
belong to a life like what you hear the life after this is. We are the
same as we are here; but the things are different. We haven&#8217;t the
same rules, the same wishes&#8212;I can&#8217;t explain.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean that we are differently conditioned?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. And if you can understand, I feel as if I remembered long
back of this, and long forward of this. But one can&#8217;t remember
forward!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That wouldn&#8217;t be remembrance; no, it would be
prescience; and your consciousness here, as you were saying yesterday,
is through knowing, not remembering.&#8221;</p>

<p>She stared at him. &#8220;Was that yesterday? I thought it
was&#8212;to-morrow.&#8221; She rubbed her hand across her forehead as
people do when they wish to clear their minds. Then she sighed deeply.
&#8220;It tires me so. And yet I can&#8217;t help trying.&#8221; A light
broke over her face at the sound of a step on the gravel walk near by,
and she said, laughing, without looking round: &#8220;That is papa! I
knew it was his step.&#8221;</p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>Such return of memory as she now had was like memory in what we call
the lower lives. It increased, fluctuantly, with an ebb in which it
almost disappeared, but with a flow that in its advance carried it
beyond its last flood-tide mark. After the first triumph in which she
could address Lanfear by his name, and could greet her father as her
father, there were lapses in which she knew them as before, without
naming them. Except mechanically to repeat the names of other people
when reminded of them, she did not pass beyond cognition to recognition.
Events still left no trace upon her; or if they did she was not sure
whether they were things she had dreamed or experienced. But her memory
grew stronger in the region where the bird knows its way home to the
nest, or the bee to the hive. She had an unerring instinct for places
where she had once been, and she found her way to them again without the
help from the association which sometimes failed Lanfear. Their walks
were always taken with her father&#8217;s company in his carriage, but
they sometimes left him at a point of the Berigo Road, and after a long
d&#233;tour among the vineyards and olive orchards of the heights above,
rejoined him at another point they had agreed upon with him. One
afternoon, when Lanfear had climbed the rough pave of the footways with
her to one of the summits, they stopped to rest on the wall of a
terrace, where they sat watching the changing light on the sea, through
a break in the trees. The shadows surprised them on their height, and
they had to make their way among them over the farm paths and by the dry
beds of the torrents to the carriage road far below. They had been that
walk only once before, and Lanfear failed of his reckoning, except the
downward course which must bring them out on the high-road at last. But
Miss Gerald&#8217;s instinct saved them where his reason failed. She did
not remember, but she knew the way, and she led him on as if she were
inventing it, or as if it had been indelibly traced upon her mind and
she had only to follow the mystical lines within to be sure of her
course. She confessed to being very tired, and each step must have
increased her fatigue, but each step seemed to clear her perception of
the next to be taken.</p>

<p>Suddenly, when Lanfear was blaming himself for bringing all this upon
her, and then for trusting to her guidance, he recognized a certain
peasant&#8217;s house, and in a few moments they had descended the
olive-orchard terraces to a broken cistern in the clear twilight beyond
the dusk. She suddenly halted him. &#8220;There, there! It happened
then&#8212;now&#8212;this instant!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That feeling of being here before! There is the curb of the
old cistern; and the place where the terrace wall is broken; and the
path up to the vineyard&#8212;Don&#8217;t you feel it, too?&#8221; she
demanded, with a joyousness which had no pleasure for him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, certainly. We were here last week. We went up the path to
the farm-house to get some water.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, now I am remembering&#8212;remembering!&#8221; She stood
with eagerly parted lips, and glancing quickly round with glowing eyes,
whose light faded in the same instant. &#8220;No!&#8221; she said,
mournfully, &#8220;it&#8217;s gone.&#8221;</p>

<p>A sound of wheels in the road ceased, and her father&#8217;s voice
called: &#8220;Don&#8217;t you want to take my place, and let me walk
awhile, Nannie?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. You come to me, papa. Something very strange has happened;
something you will be surprised at. Hurry!&#8221; She seemed to be
joking, as he was, while she beckoned him impatiently towards her.</p>

<p>He had left his carriage, and he came up with a heavy man&#8217;s
quickened pace. &#8220;Well, what is the wonderful thing?&#8221; he
panted out.</p>

<p>She stared blankly at him, without replying, and they silently made
their way to Mr. Gerald&#8217;s carriage.</p>

<p>&#8220;I lost the way, and Miss Gerald found it,&#8221; Lanfear
explained, as he helped her to the place beside her father.</p>

<p>She said nothing, and almost with sinking into the seat, she sank
into that deep slumber which from time to time overtook her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know we had gone so far&#8212;or rather that we
had waited so long before we started down the hills,&#8221; Lanfear
apologized in an involuntary whisper.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s all right,&#8221; her father said, trying to
adjust the girl&#8217;s fallen head to his shoulder. &#8220;Get in and
help me&#8212;&#8221;</p>

<p>Lanfear obeyed, and lent a physician&#8217;s skilled aid, which left
the cumbrous efforts of her father to the blame he freely bestowed on
them. &#8220;You&#8217;ll have to come here on the other side,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;There&#8217;s room enough for all three. Or, hold on! Let
me take your place.&#8221; He took the place in front, and left her to
Lanfear&#8217;s care, with the trust which was the physician&#8217;s
right, and with a sense of the girl&#8217;s dependence in which she was
still a child to him.</p>

<p>They did not speak till well on the way home. Then the father leaned
forward and whispered huskily: &#8220;Do you think she&#8217;s as strong
as she was?&#8221;</p>

<p>Lanfear waited, as if thinking the facts over. He murmured back:
&#8220;No. She&#8217;s better. She&#8217;s not so strong.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; the father murmured. &#8220;I
understand.&#8221;</p>

<p>What Gerald understood by Lanfear&#8217;s words might not have been
their meaning, but what Lanfear meant was that there was now an
interfusion of the past and present in her daily experience. She still
did not remember, but she had moments in which she hovered upon such
knowledge of what had happened as she had of actual events. When she was
stronger she seemed farther from this knowledge; when she was weaker she
was nearer it. So it seemed to him in that region where he could be sure
of his own duty when he looked upon it singly as concern for her health.
No inquiry for the psychological possibilities must be suffered to
divide his effort for her physical recovery, though there might come
with this a cessation of the timeless dream-state in which she had her
being, and she might sharply realize the past, as the anaesthete
realizes his return to agony from insensibility. The quality of her mind
was as different from the thing called culture as her manner from
convention. A simplicity beyond the simplicity of childhood was one with
a poetic color in her absolute ideas. But this must cease with her
restoration to the strength in which she could alone come into full and
clear self-consciousness. So far as Lanfear could give reality to his
occupation with her disability, he was ministering to a mind diseased;
not to &#8220;rase out its written trouble,&#8221; but if possible to
restore the obliterated record, and enable her to spell its tragic
characters. If he could, he would have shrunk from this office; but all
the more because he specially had to do with the mystical side of
medicine, he always tried to keep his relation to her free from personal
feeling, and his aim single and matter-of-fact.</p>

<p>It was hard to do this; and there was a glamour in the very
topographical and meteorological environment. The autumn was a long
delight in which the constant sea, the constant sky, knew almost as
little variance as the unchanging Alps. The days passed in a procession
of sunny splendor, neither hot nor cold, nor of the temper of any
determinate season, unless it were an abiding spring-time. The flowers
bloomed, and the grass kept green in a reverie of May. But one afternoon
of January, while Lanfear was going about in a thin coat and panama hat,
a soft, fresh wind began to blow from the east. It increased till
sunset, and then fell. In the morning he looked out on a world in which
the spring had stiffened overnight into winter. A thick frost painted
the leaves and flowers; icicles hung from pipes and vents; the frozen
streams flashed back from their arrested flow the sun as it shone from
the cold heaven, and blighted and blackened the hedges of geranium and
rose, the borders of heliotrope, the fields of pinks. The leaves of the
bananas hung limp about their stems; the palms rattled like skeletons in
the wind when it began to blow again over the shrunken landscape.</p>


<h3>VI</h3>

<p>The caprice of a climate which vaunted itself perpetual summer was a
godsend to all the strangers strong enough to bear it without suffering.
For the sick an indoor life of huddling about the ineffectual fires of
the south began, and lasted for the fortnight that elapsed before the
Riviera got back its advertised temperature. Miss Gerald had drooped in
the milder weather; but the cold braced and lifted her, and with its
help she now pushed her walks farther, and was eager every day for some
excursion to the little towns that whitened along the shores, or the
villages that glimmered from the olive-orchards of the hills. Once she
said to Lanfear, when they were climbing through the brisk, clear air:
&#8220;It seems to me as if I had been here before. Have I?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. This is the first time.&#8221;</p>

<p>She said no more, but seemed disappointed in his answer, and he
suggested: &#8220;Perhaps it is the cold that reminds you of our winters
at home, and makes you feel that the scene is familiar.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, that is it!&#8221; she returned, joyously. &#8220;Was
there snow, there, like that on the mountains yonder?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A good deal more, I fancy. That will be gone in a few days,
and at home, you know, our snow lasts for weeks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then that is what I was thinking of,&#8221; she said, and she
ran strongly and lightly forward. &#8220;Come!&#8221;</p>

<p>When the harsh weather passed and the mild climate returned there was
no lapse of her strength. A bloom, palely pink as the flowers that began
to flush the almond-trees, came upon her delicate beauty, a light like
that of the lengthening days dawned in her eyes. She had an instinct for
the earliest violets among the grass under the olives; she was first to
hear the blackcaps singing in the garden-tops; and nothing that was
novel in her experience seemed alien to it. This was the sum of what
Lanfear got by the questioning which he needlessly tried to keep
indirect. She knew that she was his patient, and in what manner, and she
had let him divine that her loss of memory was suffering as well as
deprivation. She had not merely the fatigue which we all undergo from
the effort to recall things, and which sometimes reaches exhaustion; but
there was apparently in the void of her oblivion a perpetual rumor of
events, names, sensations, like&#8212;Lanfear felt that he inadequately
conjectured&#8212;the subjective noises which are always in the ears of
the deaf. Sometimes, in the distress of it, she turned to him for help,
and when he was able to guess what she was striving for, a radiant
relief and gratitude transfigured her face. But this could not last, and
he learned to note how soon the stress and tension of her effort
returned. His compassion for her at such times involved a temptation, or
rather a question, which he had to silence by a direct effort of his
will. Would it be worse, would it be greater anguish for her to know at
once the past that now tormented her consciousness with its broken and
meaningless reverberations? Then he realized that it was impossible to
help her even through the hazard of telling her what had befallen; that
no such effect as was to be desired could be anticipated from the
outside.</p>

<p>If he turned to her father for counsel or instruction, or even a
participation in his responsibility, he was met by an optimistic
patience which exasperated him, if it did not complicate the case. Once,
when Lanfear forbearingly tried to share with him his anxiety for the
effect of a successful event, he was formed to be outright, and remind
him, in so many words, that the girl&#8217;s restoration might be
through anguish which he could not measure.</p>

<p>Gerald faltered aghast; then he said: &#8220;It mustn&#8217;t come to
that; you mustn&#8217;t let it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you expect me to prevent it?&#8221; Lanfear demanded,
in his vexation.</p>

<p>Gerald caught his breath. &#8220;If she gets well, she will
remember?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t say that. It seems probable. Do you wish her
being to remain bereft of one-half its powers?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, how do I know what I want?&#8221; the poor man groaned.
&#8220;I only know that I trust you entirely, Doctor Lanfear. Whatever
you think best will be best and wisest, no matter what the outcome
is.&#8221;</p>

<p>He got away from Lanfear with these hopeless words, and again Lanfear
perceived that the case was left wholly to him. His consolation was the
charm of the girl&#8217;s companionship, the delight of a nature knowing
itself from moment to moment as if newly created. For her, as nearly as
he could put the fact into words, the actual moment contained the past
and the future as well as the present. When he saw in her the
persistence of an exquisite personality independent of the means by
which he realized his own continuous identity, he sometimes felt as if
in the presence of some angel so long freed from earthly allegiance that
it had left all record behind, as we leave here the records of our first
years. If an echo of the past reached her, it was apt to be trivial and
insignificant, like those unimportant experiences of our remotest
childhood, which remain to us from a world outlived.</p>

<p>It was not an insipid perfection of character which reported itself
in these celestial terms, and Lanfear conjectured that angelic
immortality, if such a thing were, could not imply perfection except at
the cost of one-half of human character. When the girl wore a dress that
she saw pleased him more than another, there was a responsive pleasure
in her eyes, which he could have called vanity if he would; and she had
at times a wilfulness which he could have accused of being obstinacy.
She showed a certain jealousy of any experiences of his apart from her
own, not because they included others, but because they excluded her. He
was aware of an involuntary vigilance in her, which could not leave his
motives any more than his actions unsearched. But in her conditioning
she could not repent; she could only offer him at some other time the
unconscious reparation of her obedience. The self-criticism which the
child has not learned she had forgotten, but in her oblivion the wish to
please existed as perfectly as in the ignorance of childhood.</p>

<p>This, so far as he could ever put into words, was the interior of the
world where he dwelt apart with her. Its exterior continued very like
that of other worlds where two young people have their being. Now and
then a more transitory guest at the Grand Hotel Sardegna perhaps fancied
it the iridescent orb which takes the color of the morning sky, and is
destined, in the course of nature, to the danger of collapse in which
planetary space abounds. Some rumor of this could not fail to reach
Lanfear, but he ignored it as best he could in always speaking gravely
of Miss Gerald as his patient, and authoritatively treating her as such.
He convinced some of these witnesses against their senses; for the
others, he felt that it mattered little what they thought, since, if it
reached her, it could not pierce her isolation for more than the instant
in which the impression from absent things remained to her.</p>

<p>A more positive embarrassment, of a kind Lanfear was not prepared
for, beset him in an incident which would have been more touching if he
had been less singly concerned for the girl. A pretty English boy, with
the dawn of a peachy bloom on his young cheeks, and an impulsiveness
commoner with English youth than our own, talked with Miss Gerald one
evening and the next day sent her an armful of flowers with his card. He
followed this attention with a call at her father&#8217;s apartment, and
after Miss Gerald seemed to know him, and they had, as he told Lanfear,
a delightful time together, she took up his card from the table where it
was lying, and asked him if he could tell her who that gentleman was.
The poor fellow&#8217;s inference was that she was making fun of him,
and he came to Lanfear, as an obvious friend of the family, for an
explanation. He reported the incident, with indignant tears standing in
his eyes: &#8220;What did she mean by it? If she took my flowers, she
must have known that&#8212;that&#8212;they&#8212;And to pretend to
forget my name! Oh, I say, it&#8217;s too bad! She could have got rid of
me without that. Girls have ways enough, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes,&#8221; Lanfear assented, slowly, to gain time.
&#8220;I can assure you that Miss Gerald didn&#8217;t mean anything that
could wound you. She isn&#8217;t very well&#8212;she&#8217;s rather
odd&#8212;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean that she&#8217;s out of her mind? She can talk as
well as any one&#8212;better!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, not that. But she&#8217;s often in pain&#8212;greatly in
pain when she can&#8217;t recall a name, and I&#8217;ve no doubt she was
trying to recall yours with the help of your card. She would be the last
in the world to be indifferent to your feelings. I imagine she scarcely
knew what she was doing at the moment.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then, do you think&#8212;do you suppose&#8212;it would be any
good my trying to see her again? If she wouldn&#8217;t be indifferent to
my feelings, do you think there would be any hope&#8212;Really, you
know, I would give anything to believe that my feelings wouldn&#8217;t
offend her. You understand me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps I do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve never met a more charming girl and&#8212;she
isn&#8217;t engaged, is she? She isn&#8217;t engaged to you? I
don&#8217;t mean to press the question, but it&#8217;s a question of
life and death with me, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lanfear thought he saw his way out of the coil. &#8220;I can tell
you, quite as frankly as you ask, that Miss Gerald isn&#8217;t engaged
to <em>me</em>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then it&#8217;s somebody else&#8212;somebody in America! Well,
I hope she&#8217;ll be happy; <em>I</em> never shall.&#8221; He offered
his hand to Lanfear. &#8220;I&#8217;m off.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, here&#8217;s the doctor, now,&#8221; a voice said behind
them where they stood by the garden wall, and they turned to confront
Gerald with his daughter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why! Are you going?&#8221; she said to the Englishman, and she
put out her hand to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Mr. Evers is going.&#8221; Lanfear came to the
rescue.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m sorry,&#8221; the girl said, and the youth
responded.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s very good of you. I&#8212;good-by! I hope
you&#8217;ll be very happy&#8212;I&#8212;&#8221; He turned abruptly
away, and ran into the hotel.</p>

<p>&#8220;What has he been crying for?&#8221; Miss Gerald asked, turning
from a long look after him.</p>

<p>Lanfear did not know quite what to say; but he hazarded saying:
&#8220;He was hurt that you had forgotten him when he came to see you
this afternoon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did he come to see me?&#8221; she asked; and Lanfear exchanged
looks of anxiety, pain, and reassurance with her father. &#8220;I am so
sorry. Shall I go after him and tell him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; I explained; he&#8217;s all right,&#8221; Lanfear
said.</p>

<p>&#8220;You want to be careful, Nannie,&#8221; her father added,
&#8220;about people&#8217;s feelings when you meet them, and afterwards
seem not to know them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I <em>do</em> know them, papa,&#8221; she
remonstrated.</p>

<p>&#8220;You want to be careful,&#8221; her father repeated.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will&#8212;I will, indeed.&#8221; Her lips quivered, and the
tears came, which Lanfear had to keep from flowing by what quick turn he
could give to something else.</p>

<p>An obscure sense of the painful incident must have lingered with her
after its memory had perished. One afternoon when Lanfear and her father
went with her to the military concert in the sycamore-planted piazza
near the Vacherie Suisse, where they often came for a cup of tea, she
startled them by bowing gayly to a young lieutenant of engineers
standing there with some other officers, and making the most of the
prospect of pretty foreigners which the place afforded. The lieutenant
returned the bow with interest, and his eyes did not leave their party
as long as they remained. Within the bounds of deference for her, it was
evident that his comrades were joking about the honor done him by this
charming girl. When the Geralds started homeward Lanfear was aware of a
trio of officers following them, not conspicuously, but unmistakably;
and after that, he could not start on his walks with Miss Gerald and her
father without the sense that the young lieutenant was hovering
somewhere in their path, waiting in the hopes of another bow from her.
The officer was apparently not discouraged by his failure to win
recognition from her, and what was amounting to annoyance for Lanfear
reached the point where he felt he must share it with her father. He had
nearly as much trouble in imparting it to him as he might have had with
Miss Gerald herself. He managed, but when he required her father to put
a stop to it he perceived that Gerald was as helpless as she would have
been. He first wished to verify the fact from its beginning with her,
but this was not easy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nannie,&#8221; he said, &#8220;why did you bow to that officer
the other day?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What officer, papa? When?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You know; there by the band-stand, at the Swiss
Dairy.&#8221;</p>

<p>She stared blankly at him, and it was clear that it was all as if it
had not been with her. He insisted, and then she said: &#8220;Perhaps I
thought I knew him, and was afraid I should hurt his feelings if I
didn&#8217;t recognize him. But I don&#8217;t remember it at all.&#8221;
The curves of her mouth drooped, and her eyes grieved, so that her
father had not the heart to say more. She left them, and when he was
alone with Lanfear he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;You see how it is!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I saw how it was before. But what do you wish to
do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean that he will keep it up?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Decidedly, he&#8217;ll keep it up. He has every right to from
his point of view.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, well, then, my dear fellow, you must stop it, somehow.
You&#8217;ll know how to do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I?&#8221; said Lanfear, indignantly; but his vexation was not
so great that he did not feel a certain pleasure in fulfilling this
strangest part of his professional duty, when at the beginning of their
next excursion he put Miss Gerald into the victoria with her father and
fell back to the point at which he had seen the lieutenant waiting to
haunt their farther progress. He put himself plumply in front of the
officer and demanded in very blunt Italian: &#8220;What do you
want?&#8221;</p>

<p>The lieutenant stared him over with potential offence, in which his
delicately pencilled mustache took the shape of a light sneer, and
demanded in his turn, in English much better than Lanfear&#8217;s
Italian: &#8220;What right have you to ask?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The right of Miss Gerald&#8217;s physician. She is an invalid
in my charge.&#8221;</p>

<p>A change quite indefinable except as the visible transition from
coxcomb to gentleman passed over the young lieutenant&#8217;s comely
face. &#8220;An invalid?&#8221; he faltered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Lanfear began; and then, with a rush of confidence
which the change in the officer&#8217;s face justified, &#8220;one very
strangely, very tragically afflicted. Since she saw her mother killed in
an accident a year ago she remembers nothing. She bowed to you because
she saw you looking at her, and supposed you must be an acquaintance.
May I assure you that you are altogether mistaken?&#8221;</p>

<p>The lieutenant brought his heels together, and bent low. &#8220;I beg
her pardon with all my heart. I am very, very sorry. I will do anything
I can. I would like to stop that. May I bring my mother to call on Miss
Gerald?&#8221;</p>

<p>He offered his hand, and Lanfear wrung it hard, a lump of gratitude
in his throat choking any particular utterance, while a fine shame for
his late hostile intention covered him.</p>

<p>When the lieutenant came, with all possible circumstance, bringing
the countess, his mother, Mr. Gerald overwhelmed them with hospitality
of every form. The Italian lady responded effusively, and more sincerely
cooed and murmured her compassionate interest in his daughter. Then all
parted the best of friends; but when it was over, Miss Gerald did not
know what it had been about. She had not remembered the lieutenant or
her father&#8217;s vexation, or any phase of the incident which was now
closed. Nothing remained of it but the lieutenant&#8217;s right, which
he gravely exercised, of saluting them respectfully whenever he met
them.</p>


<h3>VII</h3>

<p>Earlier, Lanfear had never allowed himself to be far out of call from
Miss Gerald&#8217;s father, especially during the daytime slumbers into
which she fell, and from which they both always dreaded her awakening.
But as the days went on and the event continued the same he allowed
himself greater range. Formerly the three went their walks or drives
together, but now he sometimes went alone. In these absences he found
relief from the stress of his constant vigilance; he was able to cast
off the bond which enslaves the physician to his patient, and which he
must ignore at times for mere self-preservation&#8217;s sake; but there
was always a lurking anxiety, which, though he refused to let it define
itself to him, shortened the time and space he tried to put between
them.</p>

<p>One afternoon in April, when he left her sleeping, he was aware of
somewhat recklessly placing himself out of reach in a lonely excursion
to a village demolished by the earthquake of 1887, and abandoned
himself, in the impressions and incidents of his visit to the ruin, to a
luxury of impersonal melancholy which the physician cannot often allow
himself. At last, his care found him, and drove him home full of a
sharper fear than he had yet felt since the first days. But Mr. Gerald
was tranquilly smoking under a palm in the hotel garden, and met him
with an easy smile. &#8220;She woke once, and said she had had such a
pleasant dream. Now she&#8217;s off again. Do you think we&#8217;d
better wake her for dinner? I suppose she&#8217;s getting up her
strength in this way. Her sleeping so much is a good symptom,
isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Lanfear smiled forlornly; neither of them, in view of the possible
eventualities, could have said what result they wished the symptoms to
favor. But he said: &#8220;Decidedly I wouldn&#8217;t wake her&#8221;;
and he spent a night of restless sleep penetrated by a nervous
expectation which the morning, when it came, rather mockingly
defeated.</p>

<p>Miss Gerald appeared promptly at breakfast in their pavilion, with a
fresher and gayer look than usual, and to her father&#8217;s
&#8220;Well, Nannie, you <em>have</em> had a nap, this time,&#8221; she
answered, smiling:</p>

<p>&#8220;Have I? It isn&#8217;t afternoon, is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, it&#8217;s morning. You&#8217;ve napped it all
night.&#8221;</p>

<p>She said: &#8220;I can&#8217;t tell whether I&#8217;ve been asleep or
not, sometimes; but now I know I have been; and I feel so rested. Where
are we going to-day?&#8221;</p>

<p>She turned to Lanfear while her father answered: &#8220;I guess the
doctor won&#8217;t want to go very far, to-day, after his expedition
yesterday afternoon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I <em>knew</em> you had been
somewhere! Was it very far? Are you too tired?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was rather far, but I&#8217;m not tired. I shouldn&#8217;t
advise Possana, though.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Possana?&#8221; she repeated. &#8220;What is
Possana?&#8221;</p>

<p>He told her, and then at a jealous look in her eyes he added an
account of his excursion. He heightened, if anything, its difficulties,
in making light of them as no difficulties for him, and at the end she
said, gently: &#8220;Shall we go this morning?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let the doctor rest this morning, Nannie,&#8221; her father
interrupted, whimsically, but with what Lanfear knew to be an inner
yielding to her will. &#8220;Or if you won&#8217;t let <em>him</em>, let
<em>me</em>. I don&#8217;t want to go anywhere this morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lanfear thought that he did not wish her to go at all, and hoped that
by the afternoon she would have forgotten Possana. She sighed, but in
her sigh there was no concession. Then, with the chance of a returning
drowse to save him from openly thwarting her will, he merely suggested:
&#8220;There&#8217;s plenty of time in the afternoon; the days are so
long now; and we can get the sunset from the hills.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, that will be nice,&#8221; she said, but he perceived that
she did not assent willingly; and there was an effect of resolution in
the readiness with which she appeared dressed for the expedition after
luncheon. She clearly did not know where they were going, but when she
turned to Lanfear with her look of entreaty, he had not the heart to
join her father in any conspiracy against her. He beckoned the carriage
which had become conscious in its eager driver from the moment she
showed herself at the hotel door, and they set out.</p>

<p>When they had left the higher level of the hotel and began their
clatter through the long street of the town, Lanfear noted that she
seemed to feel as much as himself the quaintness of the little city,
rising on one hand, with its narrow alleys under successive arches
between the high, dark houses, to the hills, and dropping on the other
to sea from the commonplace of the principal thoroughfare, with its pink
and white and saffron hotels and shops. Beyond the town their course lay
under villa walls, covered with vines and topped by pavilions, and
opening finally along a stretch of the old Cornice road.</p>

<p>&#8220;But this,&#8221; she said, at a certain point, &#8220;is where
we were yesterday!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This is where the doctor was yesterday,&#8221; her father
said, behind his cigar.</p>

<p>&#8220;And wasn&#8217;t I with you?&#8221; she asked Lanfear.</p>

<p>He said, playfully: &#8220;To-day you are. I mustn&#8217;t be selfish
and have you every day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, you are laughing at me; but I know I was here
yesterday.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her father set his lips in patience, and Lanfear did not insist.</p>

<p>They had halted at this point because, across a wide valley on the
shoulder of an approaching height, the ruined village of Possana showed,
and lower down and nearer the seat the new town which its people had
built when they escaped from the destruction of their world-old
home.</p>

<p>World-old it all was, with reference to the human life of it; but the
spring-time was immortally young in the landscape. Over the expanses of
green and brown fields, and hovering about the gray and white cottages,
was a mist of peach and cherry blossoms. Above these the hoar olives
thickened, and the vines climbed from terrace to terrace. The valley
narrowed inland, and ceased in the embrace of the hills drawing
mysteriously together in the distances.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think we&#8217;ve got the best part of it here, Miss
Gerald,&#8221; Lanfear broke the common silence by saying. &#8220;You
couldn&#8217;t see much more of Possana after you got there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Besides,&#8221; her father ventured a pleasantry which jarred
on the younger man, &#8220;if you were there with the doctor yesterday,
you won&#8217;t want to make the climb again to-day. Give it up,
Nannie!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh no,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I can&#8217;t give it
up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then, we must go on, I suppose. Where do we begin our
climb?&#8221;</p>

<p>Lanfear explained that he had been obliged to leave his carriage at
the foot of the hill, and climb to Possana Nuova by the donkey-paths of
the peasants. He had then walked to the ruins of Possana Vecchia, but he
suggested that they might find donkeys to carry them on from the new
town.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I hope so,&#8221; Mr. Gerald grumbled. But at Possana
Nuova no saddle-donkeys were to be had, and he announced, at the caf&#233;
where they stopped for the negotiation, that he would wait for the young
people to go on to Possana Vecchia, and tell him about it when they got
back. In the meantime he would watch the game of ball, which, in the
piazza before the caf&#233;, appeared to have engaged the energies of the
male population. Lanfear was still inwardly demurring, when a stalwart
peasant girl came in and announced that she had one donkey which they
could have with her own services driving it. She had no saddle, but
there was a pad on which the young lady could ride.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, well, take it for Nannie,&#8221; Mr. Gerald directed;
&#8220;only don&#8217;t be gone too long.&#8221;</p>

<p>They set out with Miss Gerald reclining in the kind of litter which
the donkey proved to be equipped with. Lanfear went beside her, the
peasant girl came behind, and at times ran forward to instruct them in
the points they seemed to be looking at. For the most part the landscape
opened beneath them, but in the azure distances it climbed into Alpine
heights which the recent snows had now left to the gloom of their pines.
On the slopes of the nearer hills little towns clung, here and there;
closer yet farm-houses showed themselves among the vines and olives.</p>

<p>It was very simple, as the life in it must always have been; and
Lanfear wondered if the elemental charm of the scene made itself felt by
his companion as they climbed the angles of the inclines, in a silence
broken only by the picking of the donkey&#8217;s hoofs on the rude
mosaic of the pavement, and the panting of the peasant girl at its
heels. On the top of the last upward stretch they stopped for the view,
and Miss Gerald asked abruptly: &#8220;Why were you so sad?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When was I sad?&#8221; he asked, in turn.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. Weren&#8217;t you sad?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When I was here yesterday, you mean?&#8221; She smiled on his
fortunate guess, and he said: &#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t know. It might
have begun with thinking&#8212;</p>

<p class="poetry">&#8216;Of old, unhappy, far-off things, <br />And
battles long ago.&#8217;</p>

<p style="text-indent: 0em">You know the pirates used to come sailing
over the peaceful sea yonder from Africa, to harry these coasts, and
carry off as many as they could capture into slavery in Tunis and
Algiers. It was a long, dumb kind of misery that scarcely made an echo
in history, but it haunted my fancy yesterday, and I saw these valleys
full of the flight and the pursuit which used to fill them, up to the
walls of the villages, perched on the heights where men could have built
only for safety. Then, I got to thinking of other
things&#8212;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And thinking of things in the past always makes you
sad,&#8221; she said, in pensive reflection. &#8220;If it were not for
the wearying of always trying to remember, I don&#8217;t believe I
should want my memory back. And of course to be like other
people,&#8221; she ended with a sigh.</p>

<p>It was on his tongue to say that he would not have her so; but he
checked himself, and said, lamely enough: &#8220;Perhaps you will be
like them, sometime.&#8221;</p>

<p>She startled him by answering irrelevantly: &#8220;You know my mother
is dead. She died a long while ago; I suppose I must have been very
little.&#8221;</p>

<p>She spoke as if the fact scarcely concerned her, and Lanfear drew a
breath of relief in his surprise. He asked, at another tangent:
&#8220;What made you think I was sad yesterday?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I knew, somehow. I think that I always know when you are
sad; I can&#8217;t tell you how, but I feel it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I must cheer up,&#8221; Lanfear said. &#8220;If I could
only see you strong and well, Miss Gerald, like this
girl&#8212;&#8221;</p>

<p>They both looked at the peasant, and she laughed in sympathy with
their smiling, and beat the donkey a little for pleasure; it did not
mind.</p>

<p>&#8220;But you will be&#8212;you will be! We must hurry on, now, or
your father will be getting anxious.&#8221;</p>

<p>They pushed forward on the road, which was now level and wider than
it had been. As they drew near the town, whose ruin began more and more
to reveal itself in the roofless walls and windowless casements, they
saw a man coming towards them, at whose approach Lanfear instinctively
put himself forward. The man did not look at them, but passed, frowning
darkly, and muttering and gesticulating.</p>

<p>Miss Gerald turned in her litter and followed him with a long gaze.
The peasant girl said gayly in Italian: &#8220;He is mad; the earthquake
made him mad,&#8221; and urged the donkey forward.</p>

<p>Lanfear, in the interest of science, habitually forbade himself the
luxury of anything like foreboding, but now, with the passing of the
madman, he felt distinctively a lift from his spirit. He no longer
experienced the vague dread which had followed him towards Possana, and
made him glad of any delay that kept them from it.</p>

<p>They entered the crooked, narrow street leading abruptly from the
open country without any suburban hesitation into the heart of the ruin,
which kept a vivid image of uninterrupted mediaeval life. There, till
within the actual generation, people had dwelt, winter and summer, as
they had dwelt from the beginning of Christian times, with nothing to
intimate a domestic or civic advance. This street must have been the
main thoroughfare, for stone-paved lanes, still narrower, wound from it
here and there, while it kept a fairly direct course to the little
piazza on a height in the midst of the town. Two churches and a simple
town house partly enclosed it with their seamed and shattered fa&#231;ades.
The dwellings here were more ruinous than on the thoroughfare, and some
were tumbled in heaps. But Lanfear pushed open the door of one of the
churches, and found himself in an interior which, except that it was
roofless, could not have been greatly changed since the people had
flocked into it to pray for safety from the earthquake. The high altar
stood unshaken; around the frieze a succession of stucco cherubs
perched, under the open sky, in celestial security.</p>

<p>He had learned to look for the unexpected in Miss Gerald, and he
could not have said that it was with surprise he now found her as
capable of the emotions which the place inspired, as himself. He made
sure of saying: &#8220;The earthquake, you know,&#8221; and she
responded with compassion:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh yes; and perhaps that poor man was here, praying with the
rest, when it happened. How strange it must all have seemed to them,
here where they lived so safely always! They thought such a dreadful
thing could happen to others, but not to them. That is the
way!&#8221;</p>

<p>It seemed to Lanfear once more that she was on the verge of the
knowledge so long kept from her. But she went confidently on like a
sleepwalker who saves himself from dangers that would be death to him in
waking. She spoke of the earthquake as if she had been reading or
hearing of it; but he doubted if, with her broken memory, this could be
so. It was rather as if she was exploring his own mind in the way of
which he had more than once been sensible, and making use of his memory.
From time to time she spoke of remembering, but he knew that this was as
the blind speak of seeing.</p>

<p>He was anxious to get away, and at last they came out to where they
had left the peasant girl waiting beside her donkey. She was not there,
and after trying this way and that in the tangle of alleys, Lanfear
decided to take the thoroughfare which they had come up by and trust to
the chance of finding her at its foot. But he failed even of his search
for the street: he came out again and again at the point he had started
from.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is the matter?&#8221; she asked at the annoyance he could
not keep out of his face.</p>

<p>He laughed. &#8220;Oh, merely that we&#8217;re lost. But we will wait
here till that girl chooses to come back for us. Only it&#8217;s getting
late, and Mr. Gerald&#8212;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, I know the way down,&#8221; she said, and started quickly
in a direction which, as they kept it, he recognized as the route by
which he had emerged from the town the day before. He had once more the
sense of his memory being used by her, as if being blind, she had taken
his hand for guidance, or as if being herself disabled from writing, she
had directed a pen in his grasp to form the words she desired to put
down. In some mystical sort the effect was hers, but the means was
his.</p>

<p>They found the girl waiting with the donkey by the roadside beyond
the last house. She explained that, not being able to follow them into
the church with her donkey, she had decided to come where they found her
and wait for them there.</p>

<p>&#8220;Does no one at all live here?&#8221; Lanfear asked,
carelessly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Among the owls and the spectres? I would not pass a night here
for a lemonade! My mother,&#8221; she went on, with a natural pride in
the event, &#8220;was lost in the earthquake. They found her with me
before her breast, and her arms stretched out keeping the stones
away.&#8221; She vividly dramatized the fact. &#8220;I was alive, but
she was dead.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell her,&#8221; Miss Gerald said, &#8220;that my mother is
dead, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, poor little thing!&#8221; the girl said, when the message
was delivered, and she put her beast in motion, chattering gayly to Miss
Gerald in the bond of their common orphanhood.</p>

<p>The return was down-hill, and they went back in half the time it had
taken them to come. But even with this speed they were late, and the
twilight was deepening when the last turn of their road brought them in
sight of the new village. There a wild noise of cries for help burst
upon the air, mixed with the shrill sound of maniac gibbering. They saw
a boy running towards the town, and nearer them a man struggling with
another, whom he had caught about the middle, and was dragging towards
the side of the road where it dropped, hundreds of feet, into the gorge
below.</p>

<p>The donkey-girl called out: &#8220;Oh, the madman! He is killing the
signor!&#8221;</p>

<p>Lanfear shouted. The madman flung Gerald to the ground, and fled
shrieking. Miss Gerald had leaped from her seat, and followed Lanfear as
he ran forward to the prostrate form. She did not look at it, but within
a few paces she clutched her hands in her hair, and screamed out:
&#8220;Oh, my mother is killed!&#8221; and sank, as if sinking down into
the earth, in a swoon.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no; it&#8217;s all right, Nannie! Look after her, Lanfear!
I&#8217;m not hurt. I let myself go in that fellow&#8217;s hands, and I
fell softly. It was a good thing he didn&#8217;t drop me over the
edge.&#8221; Gerald gathered himself up nimbly enough, and lent Lanfear
his help with the girl. The situation explained itself, almost without
his incoherent additions, to the effect that he had become anxious, and
had started out with the boy for a guide, to meet them, and had met the
lunatic, who suddenly attacked him. While he talked, Lanfear was feeling
the girl&#8217;s pulse, and now and then putting his ear to her heart.
With a glance at her father: &#8220;You&#8217;re bleeding, Mr.
Gerald,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;So I am,&#8221; the old man answered, smiling, as he wiped a
red stream from his face with his handkerchief. &#8220;But I am not
hurt&#8212;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Better let me tie it up,&#8221; Lanfear said, taking the
handkerchief from him. He felt the unselfish quality in a man whom he
had not always thought heroic, and he bound the gash above his forehead
with a reverence mingling with his professional gentleness. The
donkey-girl had not ceased to cry out and bless herself, but suddenly,
as her care was needed in getting Miss Gerald back to the litter, she
became a part of the silence in which the procession made its way slowly
into Possana Nuova, Lanfear going on one side, and Mr. Gerald on the
other to support his daughter in her place. There was a sort of muted
outcry of the whole population awaiting them at the door of the locanda
where they had halted before, and which now had the distinction of
offering them shelter in a room especially devoted to the poor young
lady, who still remained in her swoon.</p>

<p>When the landlord could prevail with his fellow-townsmen and
townswomen to disperse in her interest, and had imposed silence upon his
customers indoors, Lanfear began his vigil beside his patient in as
great quiet as he could anywhere have had. Once during the evening the
public physician of the district looked in, but he agreed with Lanfear
that nothing was to be done which he was not doing in his greater
experience of the case. From time to time Gerald had suggested sending
for some San Remo physician in consultation. Lanfear had always
approved, and then Gerald had not persisted. He was strongly excited,
and anxious not so much for his daughter&#8217;s recovery from her
swoon, which he did not doubt, as for the effect upon her when she
should have come to herself.</p>

<p>It was this which he wished to discuss, sitting fallen back into his
chair, or walking up and down the room, with his head bound with a
bloody handkerchief, and looking, with a sort of alien picturesqueness,
like a kindly brigand.</p>

<p>Lanfear did not leave his place beside the bed where the girl lay,
white and still as if dead. An inexpressible compassion for the poor man
filled his heart. Whatever the event should be, it would be tragical for
him. &#8220;Go to sleep, Mr. Gerald,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Your waking
can do no good. I will keep watch, and if need be, I&#8217;ll call you.
Try to make yourself easy on that couch.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall not sleep,&#8221; the old man answered. &#8220;How
could I?&#8221; Nevertheless, he adjusted himself to the hard pillows of
the lounge where he had been sitting and drowsed among them. He woke
just before dawn with a start. &#8220;I thought she had come to, and
knew everything! What a nightmare! Did I groan? Is there any
change?&#8221;</p>

<p>Lanfear, sitting by the bed, in the light of the wasting candle,
which threw a grotesque shadow of him on the wall, shook his head. After
a moment he asked: &#8220;How long did you tell me her swoon had lasted
after the accident to her mother?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think she recovered consciousness for two days,
and then she remembered nothing. What do you think are the chances of
her remembering now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. But there&#8217;s a kind of psychopathic
logic&#8212;If she lost her memory through one great shock, she might
find it through another.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes!&#8221; the father said, rising and walking to and
fro, in his anguish. &#8220;That was what I thought&#8212;what I was
afraid of. If I could die myself, and save her from living through
it&#8212;I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m saying! But if&#8212;but
if&#8212;if she could somehow be kept from it a little longer! But she
can&#8217;t, she can&#8217;t! She must know it now when she
wakes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lanfear had put up his hand, and taken the girl&#8217;s slim wrist
quietly between his thumb and finger, holding it so while her father
talked on.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose it&#8217;s been a sort of weakness&#8212;a sort of
wickedness&#8212;in me to wish to keep it from her; but I <em>have</em>
wished that, doctor; you must have seen it, and I can&#8217;t deny it.
We ought to bear what is sent us in this world, and if we escape we must
pay for our escape. It has cost her half her being, I know it; but it
hasn&#8217;t cost her her reason, and I&#8217;m afraid for that, if she
comes into her memory now. Still, you must do&#8212;But no one can do
anything either to hinder or to help!&#8221;</p>

<p>He was talking in a husky undertone, and brokenly, incoherently. He
made an appeal, which Lanfear seemed not to hear, where he remained
immovable with his hand on the girl&#8217;s pulse.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think I am to blame for wishing her never to know it,
though without it she must remain deprived of one whole side of life? Do
you think my wishing that can have had anything to do with keeping
her&#8212;But this faint <em>may</em> pass and she may wake from it just
as she has been. It is logical that she should remember; but is it
certain that she will?&#8221;</p>

<p>A murmur, so very faint as to be almost no sound at all, came like a
response from the girl&#8217;s lips, and she all but imperceptibly
stirred. Her father neither heard nor saw, but Lanfear started forward.
He made a sudden clutch at the girl&#8217;s wrist with the hand that had
not left it and then remained motionless. &#8220;She will never remember
now&#8212;here.&#8221;</p>

<p>He fell on his knees beside the bed and began to sob. &#8220;Oh, my
dearest! My poor girl! My love!&#8221; still keeping her wrist in his
hand, and laying his head tenderly on her arm. Suddenly he started, with
a shout: &#8220;The pulse!&#8221; and fell forward, crushing his ear
against her heart, and listened with bursts of: &#8220;It&#8217;s
beating! She isn&#8217;t dead! She&#8217;s alive!&#8221; Then he lifted
her in his arms, and it was in his embrace that she opened her eyes, and
while she clung to him, entreated:</p>

<p>&#8220;My father! Where is he?&#8221;</p>

<p>A dread fell upon both the men, blighting the joy with which they
welcomed her back to life. She took her father&#8217;s head between her
hands, and kissed his bruised face. &#8220;I thought you were dead; and
I thought that mamma&#8212;&#8221; She stopped, and they waited
breathless. &#8220;But that was long ago, wasn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; her father eagerly assented. &#8220;Very long
ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I remember,&#8221; she sighed. &#8220;I thought that I was
killed, too. Was it <em>all</em> a dream?&#8221; Her father and Lanfear
looked at each other. Which should speak? &#8220;This is Doctor Lanfear,
isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; she asked, with a dim smile. &#8220;And I&#8217;m
not dreaming now, am I?&#8221; He had released her from his arms, but
she held his hand fast. &#8220;I know it is you, and papa; and yes, I
remember everything. That terrible pain of forgetting is gone!
It&#8217;s beautiful! But did he hurt you badly, papa? I saw him, and I
wanted to call to you. But mamma&#8212;&#8221;</p>

<p>However the change from the oblivion of the past had been operated,
it had been mercifully wrought. As far as Lanfear could note it, in the
rapture of the new revelation to her which it scarcely needed words to
establish, the process was a gradual return from actual facts to the
things of yesterday and then to the things of the day before, and so
back to the tragedy in which she had been stricken. There was no sudden
burst of remembrance, but a slow unveiling of the reality in which her
spirit was mystically fortified against it. At times it seemed to him
that the effect was accomplished in her by supernatural agencies such
as, he remembered once somewhere reading, attend the souls of those
lately dead, and explore their minds till every thought and deed of
their earthly lives, from the last to the first, is revealed to them out
of an inner memory which can never, any jot or tittle, perish. It was as
if this had remained in her intact from the blow that shattered her
outer remembrance. When the final, long-dreaded horror was reached, it
was already a sorrow of the past, suffered and accepted with the
resignation which is the close of grief, as of every other passion.</p>

<p>Love had come to her help in the time of her need, but not love alone
helped her live back to the hour of that supreme experience and beyond
it. In the absorbing interest of her own renascence, the shock, more
than the injury which her father had undergone, was ignored, if not
neglected. Lanfear had not, indeed, neglected it; but he could not help
ignoring it in his happiness, as he remembered afterwards in the
self-reproach which he would not let the girl share with him. Nothing,
he realized, could have availed if everything had been done which he did
not do; but it remained a pang with him that he had so dimly felt his
duty to the gentle old man, even while he did it. Gerald lived to
witness his daughter&#8217;s perfect recovery of the self so long lost
to her; he lived, with a joy more explicit than their own, to see her
the wife of the man to whom she was dearer than love alone could have
made her. He lived beyond that time, rejoicing, if it may be so said, in
the fond memories of her mother which he had been so long forbidden by
her affliction to recall. Then, after the spring of the Riviera had
whitened into summer, and San Remo hid, as well as it could, its sunny
glare behind its pines and palms, Gerald suffered one long afternoon
through the heat till the breathless evening, and went early to bed. He
had been full of plans for spending the rest of the summer at the little
place in New England where his daughter knew that her mother lay. In the
morning he did not wake.</p>

<p>&#8220;He gave his life that I might have mine!&#8221; she lamented
in the first wild grief.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, don&#8217;t say that, Nannie,&#8221; her husband
protested, calling her by the pet name which her father always used.
&#8220;He is dead; but if we owe each other to his loss, it is because
he was given, not because he gave himself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I know, I know!&#8221; she wailed. &#8220;But he would
gladly have given himself for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>That, perhaps, Lanfear could not have denied, and he had no wish to
do so. He had a prescience of happiness for her which the future did not
belie; and he divined that a woman must not be forbidden the extremes
within which she means to rest her soul.</p>




<h2><a name="chapter2" id="chapter2">II</a></h2>

<h2 class="chaptertitle">The Eidolons of Brooks Alford</h2>


<p>I should like to give the story of Alford&#8217;s experiences just as
Wanhope told it, sitting with us before the glowing hearth in the
Turkish room, one night after the other diners at our club had gone away
to digest their dinners at the theatre, or in their bachelor apartments
up-town, or on the late trains which they were taking north, south, and
west; or had hurried back to their offices to spend the time stolen from
rest in overwork for which their famished nerves would duly revenge
themselves. It was undoubtedly overwork which preceded Alford&#8217;s
experiences if it did not cause them, for he was pretty well broken from
it when he took himself off in the early summer, to put the pieces
together as best he could by the seaside. But this was a fact which
Wanhope was not obliged to note to us, and there were certain other
commonplaces of our knowledge of Alford which he could omit without
omitting anything essential to our understanding of the facts which he
dealt with so delicately, so electly, almost affectionately, coaxing
each point into the fittest light, and then lifting his phrase from it,
and letting it stand alone in our consciousness. I remember particularly
how he touched upon the love-affair which was supposed to have so much
to do with Alford&#8217;s break-up, and how he dismissed it to its
proper place in the story. As he talked on, with scarcely an
interruption either from the eager credulity of Rulledge or the doubt of
Minver, I heard with a sensuous comfort&#8212;I can use no other
word&#8212;the far-off click of the dishes in the club kitchen, putting
away till next day, with the musical murmur of a smitten glass or the
jingle of a dropped spoon. But if I should try to render his words, I
should spoil their impression in the vain attempt, and I feel that it is
best to give the story as best I can in words of my own, so far from
responsive to the requisitions of the occult incident.</p>

<p>The first intimation Alford had of the strange effect, which from
first to last was rather an obsession than a possession of his, was
after a morning of idle satisfaction spent in watching the target
practice from the fort in the neighborhood of the little fishing-village
where he was spending the summer. The target was two or three miles out
in the open water beyond the harbor, and he found his pleasure in
watching the smoke of the gun for that discrete interval before the
report reached him, and then for that somewhat longer interval before he
saw the magnificent splash of the shot which, as it plunged into the
sea, sent a fan-shaped fountain thirty or forty feet into the air. He
did not know and he did not care whether the target was ever hit or not.
That fact was no part of his concern. His affair was to watch the burst
of smoke from the fort and then to watch the upward gush of water,
almost as light and vaporous to the eye, where the ball struck. He did
not miss one of the shots fired during the forenoon, and when he met the
other people who sat down with him at the midday dinner in the hotel,
his talk with them was naturally of the morning&#8217;s practice. They
one and all declared it a great nuisance, and said that it had shattered
their nerves terribly, which was not perhaps so strange, since they were
all women. But when they asked him in his quality of nervous wreck
whether he had not suffered from the prolonged and repeated explosions,
too, he found himself able to say no, that he had enjoyed every moment
of the firing. He added that he did not believe he had even noticed the
noise after the first shot, he was so wholly taken with the beauty of
the fountain-burst from the sea which followed; and as he spoke the
fan-like spray rose and expanded itself before his eyes, quite blotting
out the visage of a young widow across the table. In his swift
recognition of the fact and his reflection upon it, he realized that the
effect was quite as if he had been looking at some intense light, almost
as if he had been looking at the sun, and that the illusion which had
blotted out the agreeable reality opposite was of the quality of those
flying shapes which repeat themselves here, there, and everywhere that
one looks, after lifting the gaze from a dazzling object. When his
consciousness had duly registered this perception, there instantly
followed a recognition of the fact that the eidolon now filling his
vision was not the effect of the dazzled eyes, but of a mental process,
of thinking how the thing which it reported had looked.</p>

<p>By the time Alford had co-ordinated this reflection with the other,
the eidolon had faded from the lady&#8217;s face, which again presented
itself in uninterrupted loveliness with the added attraction of a
distinct pout.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Mr. Alford!&#8221; she bantered him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I beg your pardon! I was thinking&#8212;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not of what I was saying,&#8221; she broke in, laughingly,
forgivingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I certainly wasn&#8217;t,&#8221; he assented, with such a
sense of approaching creepiness in his experience that when she
challenged him to say what he <em>was</em> thinking of, he could not, or
would not; she professed to believe that he would not.</p>

<p>In the joking that followed he soon lost the sense of approaching
creepiness, and began to be proud of what had happened to him as out of
the ordinary, as a species of psychological ecstasy almost of spiritual
value. From time to time he tried, by thinking of the splash and upward
gush from the cannon-shot&#8217;s plunge in the sea, to recall the
vision, but it would not come again, and at the end of an afternoon
somewhat distraughtly spent he decided to put the matter away, as one of
the odd things of no significance which happen in life and must be dealt
with as mysteries none the less trifling because they are
inexplicable.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you&#8217;ve got over it?&#8221; the widow joked him as
he drew up towards her, smiling from her rocker on the veranda after
supper. At first, all the women in the hotel had petted him; but with
their own cares and ailments to reclaim them they let the invalid fall
to the peculiar charge of the childless widow who had nothing else to
do, and was so well and strong that she could look after the invalid
Professor of Archaeology (at the Champlain University) without the
fatigues they must feel.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;ve got over it,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;And what was it?&#8221; she boldly pursued.</p>

<p>He was about to say, and then he could not.</p>

<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t tell?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not yet,&#8221; he answered. He added, after a moment,
&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe I can.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because it&#8217;s confidential?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; not exactly that. Because it&#8217;s
impossible.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s simple enough. I understand exactly what you
mean. Well, if ever it becomes less difficult, remember that I should
always like to know. It seemed a little&#8212;personal.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How in the world?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, when one is stared at in that way&#8212;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did I stare?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you <em>always</em> stare? But in this case you
stared as if there was something wrong with my hair.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There wasn&#8217;t,&#8221; Alford protested, simple-heartedly.
Then he recollected his sophistication to say: &#8220;Unless its being
of that particular shade between brown and red was wrong.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, thank you, Mr. Alford! After that I <em>must</em> believe
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>They talked on the veranda till the night fell, and then they came in
among the lamps, in the parlor, and she sat down with a certain
provisionality, putting herself sideways on a light chair by a window,
and as she chatted and laughed with one cheek towards him she now and
then beat the back of her chair with her open hand. The other people
were reading or severely playing cards, and they, too, kept their tones
down to a respectful level, while she lingered, and when she rose and
said good-night he went out and took some turns on the veranda before
going up to bed. She was certainly, he realized, a very pretty woman,
and very graceful and very amusing, and though she probably knew all
about it, she was the franker and honester for her knowledge.</p>

<p>He had arrived at this conclusion just as he turned the switch of the
electric light inside his door, and in the first flash of the carbon
film he saw her sitting beside the window in such a chair as she had
taken and in the very pose which she had kept in the parlor. Her
half-averted face was lit as from laughing, and she had her hand lifted
as if to beat the back of her chair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good Heavens, Mrs. Yarrow!&#8221; he said, in a sort of
whispered shout, while he mechanically closed the door behind him as if
to keep the fact to himself. &#8220;What in the world are you doing
here?&#8221;</p>

<p>Then she was not there. Nothing was there; not even a chair beside
the window.</p>

<p>Alford dropped weakly into the only chair in the room, which stood
next the door by the head of his bed, and abandoned himself a helpless
prey to the logic of the events.</p>

<p>It was at this point, which I have been able to give in
Wanhope&#8217;s exact words, that, in the ensuing pause, Rulledge asked,
as if he thought some detail might be denied him: &#8220;And what was
the logic of the events?&#8221;</p>

<p>Minver gave a fleering laugh. &#8220;Don&#8217;t be premature,
Rulledge. If you have the logic now, you will spoil everything. You
can&#8217;t have the moral until you&#8217;ve had the whole story. Go
on, Wanhope. You&#8217;re so much more interesting than usual that I
won&#8217;t ask how you got hold of all these compromising
minutiae.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; Wanhope returned, &#8220;they&#8217;re not
for the general ear. I go rather further, for the sake of the curious
fact, than I should be warranted in doing if I did not know my audience
so well.&#8221;</p>

<p>We joined in a murmur of gratification, and he went on to say that
Alford&#8217;s first coherent thought was that he was dreaming one of
those unwarranted dreams in which we make our acquaintance privy to all
sorts of strange incidents. Then he knew that he was not dreaming, and
that his eye had merely externated a mental vision, as in the case of
the cannon-shot splash of which he had seen the phantom as soon as it
was mentioned. He remembered afterwards asking himself in a sort of
terror how far it was going to go with him; how far his thought was
going to report itself objectively hereafter, and what were the
reasonable implications of his abnormal experiences. He did not know
just how long he sat by his bedside trying to think, only to have his
conclusions whir away like a flock of startled birds when he approached
them. He went to bed because he was exhausted rather than because he was
sleepy, but he could not recall a moment of wakefulness after his head
touched the pillow.</p>

<p>He woke surprisingly refreshed, but at the belated breakfast where he
found Mrs. Yarrow still lingering he thought her looking not well. She
confessed, listlessly, that she had not rested well. She was not sure,
she said, whether the sea air agreed with her; she might try the
mountains a little later. She was not inclined to talk, and that day he
scarcely spoke with her except in commonplaces at the table. They had no
return to the little mystery they had mocked together the day
before.</p>

<p>More days passed, and Alford had no recurrence of his visions. His
acquaintance with Mrs. Yarrow made no further advance; there was no one
else in the hotel who interested him, and he bored himself. At the same
time his recovery seemed retarded; he lost tone, and after a fortnight
he ran up to talk himself over with his doctor in Boston. He rather
thought he would mention his eidolons, and ask if they were at all
related to the condition of his nerves. It was a keen disappointment,
but it ought not to have been a surprise, for him to find that his
doctor was off on his summer vacation. The caretaker who opened the door
to Alford named a young physician in the same block of Marlborough
Street who had his doctor&#8217;s practice for the summer, but Alford
had not the heart to go to this alternate.</p>

<p>He started down to his hotel on a late afternoon train that would
bring him to the station after dusk, and before he reached it the lamps
had been lighted in his car. Alford sat in a sparsely peopled smoker,
where he had found a place away from the crowd in the other coaches, and
looked out of the window into the reflected interior of his car, which
now and then thinned away and let him see the weeds and gravel of the
railroad banks, with the bushes that topped them and the woods that
backed them. The train at one point stopped rather suddenly and then
went on, for no reason that he ever cared to inquire; but as it slowly
moved forward again he was reminded of something he had seen one night
in going to New York just before the train drew into Springfield. It had
then made such another apparently reasonless stop; but before it resumed
its course Alford saw from his window a group of trainmen, and his own
Pullman conductor with his lantern on his arm, bending over the figure
of a man defined in his dark clothing against the snow of the bank where
he lay propped. His face was waxen white, and Alford noted how
particularly black the mustache looked traversing the pallid visage. He
never knew whether the man was killed or merely stunned; you learn
nothing with certainty of such things on trains; but now, as he thought
of the incident, its eidolon showed itself outside of his mind, and
followed him in every detail, even to a snowy stretch of the embankment,
until the increasing speed of the train seemed to sweep it back out of
sight.</p>

<p>Alford turned his eyes to the interior of the smoker, which, except
for two or three dozing commuters and a noisy euchre-party, had been
empty of everything but the fumes and stale odors of tobacco, and found
it swarming with visions, the eidolons of everything he remembered from
his past life. Whatever had once strongly impressed itself upon his
nerves was reported there again as instantly as he thought of it. It was
largely a whirling chaos, a kaleidoscopic jumble of facts; but from time
to time some more memorable and important experience visualized itself
alone. Such was the death-bed of the little sister whom he had been
wakened, a child, to see going to heaven, as they told him. Such was the
pathetic, foolish face of the girl whom long ago he had made believe he
cared for, and then had abruptly broken with: he saw again, with
heartache, her silly, tender amaze when he said he was going away. Such
was the look of mute astonishment, of gentle reproach, in the eyes of
the friend, now long dead, whom in a moment of insensate fury he had
struck on the mouth, and who put his hand to his bleeding lips as he
bent that gaze of wonder and bewilderment upon him. But it was not alone
the dreadful impressions that reported themselves. There were others, as
vivid, which came back in the original joyousness: the face of his
mother looking up at him from the crowd on a day of college triumph when
he was delivering the valedictory of his class; the collective gayety of
the whole table on a particularly delightful evening at his dining-club;
his own image in the glass as he caught sight of it on coming home
accepted by the woman who afterwards jilted him; the transport which
lighted up his father&#8217;s visage when he stepped ashore from the
vessel which had been rumored lost, and he could be verified by the
senses as still alive; the comical, bashful ecstasy of the good fellow,
his ancient chum, in telling him he had had a son born the night before,
and the mother was doing well, and how he laughed and danced, and
skipped into the air.</p>

<p>The smoker was full of these eidolons and of others which came and
went with constant vicissitude. But what was of a greater weirdness than
seeing them within it was seeing them without in that reflection of the
interior which travelled with it through the summer night, and repeated
it, now dimly, now brilliantly, in every detail. Alford sat in a daze,
with a smile which he was aware of, fixed and stiff as if in plaster, on
his face, and with his gaze bent on this or that eidolon, and then on
all of them together. He was not so much afraid of them as of being
noticed by the other passengers in the smoker, to whom he knew he might
look very queer. He said to himself that he was making the whole thing,
but the very subjectivity was what filled him with a deep and hopeless
dread. At last the train ceased its long leaping through the dark, and
with its coming to a stand the whole illusion vanished. He heard a gay
voice which he knew bidding some one good-bye who was getting into the
car just back of the smoker, and as he descended to the platform he
almost walked into the arms of Mrs. Yarrow.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Mr. Alford! We had given you up. We thought you
wouldn&#8217;t come back till to-morrow&#8212;or perhaps ever. What in
the world will you do for supper? The kitchen fires were out ages
ago!&#8221;</p>

<p>In the light of the station electrics she beamed upon him, and he
felt glad at heart, as if he had been saved from something, a mortal
danger or a threatened shame. But he could not speak at once; his teeth
closed with tetanic force upon each other. Later, as they walked to the
hotel, through the warm, soft night in which the south wind was roaming
the starless heavens for rain, he found his voice, and although he felt
that he was speaking unnaturally, he made out to answer the lively
questions with which she pelted him too thickly to expect them to be
answered severally. She told him all the news of the day, and when she
began on yesterday&#8217;s news she checked herself with a laugh and
said she had forgotten that he had only been gone since morning.
&#8220;But now,&#8221; she said, &#8220;you see how you&#8217;ve been
missed&#8212;how <em>any</em> man must be missed in a hotel full of
women.&#8221;</p>

<p>She took charge of him when they got to the house, and said if he
would go boldly into the dining-room, where they detected, as they
approached, one lamp scantly shining from the else darkened windows, she
would beard the lioness in her den, by which she meant the cook in the
kitchen, and see what she could get him for supper. Apparently she could
get nothing warm, for when a reluctant waitress appeared it was with
such a chilly refection on her tray that Alford, though he was not very
hungry, returned from interrogating the obscurity for eidolons, and
shivered at it. At the same time the swing-door of the long, dim room
opened to admit a gush of the outer radiance on which Mrs. Yarrow
drifted in with a chafing-dish in one hand and a tea-basket in the
other. She floated tiltingly towards him like, he thought, a pretty
little ship, and sent a cheery hail before.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been trying to get somebody to join you at a
premature Welsh-rarebit and a belated cup of tea, but I can&#8217;t tear
one of the tabbies from their cards or the kittens from their gambols in
the amusement-hall in the basement. Do you mind so very much having it
alone? Because you&#8217;ll have to, whether you do or not. Unless you
call me company, when I&#8217;m merely cook.&#8221;</p>

<p>She put her utensils on the table beside the forbidding tray the
waitress had left, and helped lift herself by pressing one hand on the
top of a chair towards the electric, which she flashed up to keep the
dismal lamp in countenance. Alford let her do it. He durst not, he felt,
stir from his place, lest any movement should summon back the eidolons;
and now in the sudden glare of light he shyly, slyly searched the room
for them. Not one, fair or foul, showed itself, and slowly he felt a
great weight lifting from his heart. In its place there sprang up a
joyous gratitude towards Mrs. Yarrow, who had saved him from them, from
himself. An inexpressible tenderness filled his breast; the tears rose
to his eyes; a soft glow enveloped his whole being, a warmth of hope, a
freshness of life renewed, encompassed him. He wished to take her in his
arms, to tell her how he loved her; and as she bustled about, lighting
the lamp of her chafing-dish, and kindling the little spirit-stove she
had brought with her to make tea, he let his gaze dwell upon every pose,
every motion of her with a glad hunger in which no smallest detail was
lost. He now believed that without her he must die, without her he could
not wish to live.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jove,&#8221; Rulledge broke in at this point of
Wanhope&#8217;s story, which I am telling again so badly, &#8220;I think
Alford was in luck.&#8221;</p>

<p>Minver gave a harsh cackle. &#8220;The only thing Rulledge finds
fault with in this club is &#8216;the lack of woman&#8217;s nursing and
the lack of woman&#8217;s tears.&#8217; Nothing is wanting to his
enjoyment of his victuals but the fact that they are not served by a
neat-handed Phyllis, like Alford&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rulledge glanced towards Wanhope, and innocently inquired, &#8220;Was
that her first name?&#8221;</p>

<p>Minver burst into a scream, and Rulledge looked red and silly for
having given himself away; but he made an excursion to the buffet
outside, and returned with a sandwich with which he supported himself
stolidly under Minver&#8217;s derision, until Wanhope came to his relief
by resuming his story, or rather his study, of Alford&#8217;s strange
experience.</p>

<p>Mrs. Yarrow first gave Alford his tea, as being of a prompter brew
than the rarebit, but she was very quick and apt with that, too; and
pretty soon she leaned forward, and in the glow from the lamp under the
chafing-dish, which spiritualized her charming face with its thin
radiance, puffed the flame out with her pouted lips, and drew back with
a long-sighed &#8220;There! That will make you see your grandmother, if
anything will.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My grandmother?&#8221; Alford repeated.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. Wouldn&#8217;t you like to?&#8221; Mrs.. Yarrow asked,
pouring the thick composition over the toast (rescued stone-cold from
the frigid tray) on Alford&#8217;s plate. &#8220;I&#8217;m sure I should
like to see mine&#8212;dear old gran! Not that I ever saw
her&#8212;either of her&#8212;or should know how she looked. Did you
ever see yours&#8212;either of her?&#8221; she pursued, impulsively.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh yes,&#8221; Alford answered, looking intently at her, but
with so little speculation in the eyes he glared so with that he knew
her to be uneasy under them.</p>

<p>She laughed a little, and stayed her hand on the bail of the teapot.
&#8220;Which of her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, both!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And&#8212;and&#8212;did she look so much like
<em>me?</em>&#8221; she said, with an added laugh, that he perceived had
an hysterical note in it. &#8220;You&#8217;re letting your rarebit get
cold!&#8221;</p>

<p>He laughed himself, now, a great laugh of relaxation, of relief.
&#8220;Not the least in the world! She was not exactly a phantom of
delight.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, thank you, Mr. Alford. Now, it&#8217;s your tea&#8217;s
getting cold.&#8221;</p>

<p>They laughed together, and he gave himself to his victual with a
relish that she visibly enjoyed. When that question of his grandmother
had been pushed he thought of an awful experience of his childhood,
which left on his infant mind an indelible impression, a scar, to remain
from the original wound forever. He had been caught in a lie, the first
he could remember, but by no means the last, by many immemorable
thousands. His poor little wickedness had impugned the veracity of both
these terrible old ladies, who, habitually at odds with each other, now
united, for once, against him. He could always see himself, a mean
little blubbering-faced rascal, stealing guilty looks of imploring at
their faces, set unmercifully against him, one in sorrow and one in
anger, requiring his mother to whip him, and insisting till he was led,
loudly roaring, into the parlor, and there made a liar of for all time,
so far as fear could do it.</p>

<p>When Mrs. Yarrow asked if he had ever seen his grandmother he
expected instantly to see her, in duplicate, and as a sole refuge, but
with little hope that it would save him, he kept his eyes fast on hers,
and to his unspeakable joy it did avail. No other face, of sorrow or of
anger, rose between them. For the time his thought was quit of its
consequence; no eidolon outwardly repeated his inward vision. A warm
gush of gratitude seemed to burst from his heart, and to bathe his whole
being, and then to flow in a tide of ineffable tenderness towards Mrs.
Yarrow, and involve her and bear them together heavenward. It was not
passion, it was not love, he perceived well enough; it was the utterance
of a vital conviction that she had saved him from an overwhelming
subjective horror, and that in her sweet objectivity there was a
security and peace to be found nowhere else.</p>

<p>He greedily ate every atom of his rarebit, he absorbed every drop of
the moisture in the teapot, so that when she shook it and shook it, and
then tried to pour something from it, there was no slightest dribble at
the spout. But they lingered, talking and laughing, and perhaps they
might never have left the place if the hard handmaiden who had brought
the tea-tray had not first tried putting her head in at the swing-door
from the kitchen, and then, later, come boldly in and taken the tray
away.</p>

<p>Mrs. Yarrow waited self-respectfully for her disappearance, and then
she said, &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid that was a hint, Mr.
Alford.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It seemed like one,&#8221; he owned.</p>

<p>They went out together, gayly chatting, but she would not encourage
the movement he made towards the veranda. She remained firmly attached
to the newel-post of the stairs, and at the first chance he gave her she
said good-night and bounded lightly upward. At the turn of the stairs
she stopped and looked laughing down at him over the rail. &#8220;I hope
you won&#8217;t see your grandmother.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, not a bit of it,&#8221; he called back. He felt that he
failed to give his reply the quality of epigram, but he was not unhappy
in his failure.</p>

<p>Many light-hearted days followed this joyous evening. No eidolons
haunted Alford&#8217;s horizon, perhaps because Mrs. Yarrow filled his
whole heaven. She was very constantly with him, guiding his wavering
steps up the hill of recovery, which he climbed with more and more
activity, and keeping him company in those valleys of relapse into which
he now and then fell back from the difficult steeps. It came to be
tacitly, or at least passively, conceded by the other ladies that she
had somehow earned the exclusive right to what had once been the common
charge; or that if one of their number had a claim to keep Mr. Alford
from killing himself by all sorts of imprudences, which in his case
amounted to impieties, it was certainly Mrs. Yarrow. They did not put
this in terms, but they felt it and acted it.</p>

<p>She was all the safer guardian for a delicate invalid because she
loathed manly sports so entirely that she did not even pretend to like
them, as most women, poor things, think themselves obliged to do. In her
hands there was no danger that he would be tempted to excesses in golf.
She was really afraid of all boats, but she was willing to go out with
him in the sail-boat of a superannuated skipper, because to sit talking
in the stern and stoop for the vagaries of the boom in tacking was such
good exercise. She would join him in fishing from the rotting pier, but
with no certainty which was a cunner and which was a sculpin, when she
caught it, and with an equal horror of both the nasty, wriggling things.
When they went a walk together, her notion of a healthful tramp was to
find a nice place among the sweet-fern or the pine-needles, and sit down
in it and talk, or make a lap, to which he could bring the berries he
gathered for her to arrange in the shallow leaf-trays she pinned
together with twigs. She really preferred a rocking-chair on the veranda
to anything else; but if he wished to go to those other excesses, she
would go with him, to keep him out of mischief.</p>

<p>There could be only one credible reading of the situation, but Alford
let the summer pass in this pleasant dreaming without waking up till too
late to the pleasanter reality. It will seem strange enough, but it is
true, that it was no part of his dream to fancy that Mrs. Yarrow was in
love with him. He knew very well, long before the end, that he was in
love with her; but, remaining in the dark otherwise, he considered only
himself in forbearing verbally to make love to her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well!&#8221; Rulledge snarled at this point, &#8220;he
<em>was</em> a chump.&#8221;</p>

<p>Wanhope at the moment opposed nothing directly to the censure, but
said that something pathetically reproachful in Mrs. Yarrow&#8217;s
smiling looks penetrated to Alford as she nodded gayly from the car
window to him in the little group which had assembled to see her off at
the station when she left, by no means the first of their happy hotel
circle to go.</p>

<p>&#8220;Somebody,&#8221; Rulledge burst out again, &#8220;ought to
have kicked him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s become,&#8221; Minver asked, &#8220;of all the
dear maids and widows that you&#8217;ve failed to marry at the end of
each summer, Rulledge?&#8221;</p>

<p>The satire involved flattery so sweet that Rulledge could not perhaps
wish to make any retort. He frowned sternly, and said, with a face
averted from Minver: &#8220;Go on, Wanhope!&#8221;</p>

<p>Wanhope here permitted himself a philosophical excursion in which I
will not accompany him. It was apparently to prepare us for the dramatic
fact which followed, and which I suppose he was trying rather to work
away from than work up to. It included some facts which he had failed to
touch on before, and which led to a discussion very interesting in
itself, but of a range too great for the limits I am trying to keep
here. It seems that Alford had been stayed from declaring his love not
only because he doubted of its nature, but also because he questioned
whether a man in his broken health had any right to offer himself to a
woman, and because from a yet finer scruple he hesitated in his poverty
to ask the hand of a rich woman. On the first point, we were pretty well
agreed, but on the second we divided again, especially Rulledge and
Minver, who held, the one, that his hesitation did Alford honor, and
quite relieved him from the imputation of being a chump; and the other
that he was an ass to keep quiet for any such silly reason. Minver
contended that every woman had a right, whether rich or poor, to the man
who loved her; and, moreover, there were now so many rich women that, if
they were not allowed to marry poor men, their chances of marriage were
indefinitely reduced. What better could a widow do with the money she
had inherited from a husband she probably did not love than give it to a
man like Alford&#8212;or to an ass like Alford, Minver corrected
himself.</p>

<p>His <i>reductio ad absurdum</i> allowed Wanhope to resume with a laugh,
and say that Alford waited at the station in the singleness to which the
tactful dispersion of the others had left him, and watched the train
rapidly dwindle in the perspective, till an abrupt turn of the road
carried it out of sight. Then he lifted his eyes with a long sigh, and
looked round. Everywhere he saw Mrs. Yarrow&#8217;s smiling face with
that inner pathos. It swarmed upon him from all points; and wherever he
turned it repeated itself in the distances like that succession of faces
you see when you stand between two mirrors.</p>

<p>It was not merely a lapse from his lately hopeful state with Alford,
it was a collapse. The man withered and dwindled away, till he felt that
he must audibly rattle in his clothes as he walked by people. He did not
walk much. Mostly he remained shrunken in the arm-chair where he used to
sit beside Mrs. Yarrow&#8217;s rocker, and the ladies, the older and the
older-fashioned, who were &#8220;sticking it out&#8221; at the hotel
till it should close on the 15th of September, observed him, some
compassionately, some censoriously, but all in the same conviction.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s plain to be seen what ails Mr. Alford,
<em>now</em>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I guess it <em>is</em>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<em>I</em> guess so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I <em>guess</em> it is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Seems kind of heartless, her going and leaving him
so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Like a sick kitten!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I should say as <em>much</em>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your eyes bother you, Mr. Alford?&#8221; one of them chanted,
breaking from their discussion of him to appeal directly to him. He was
rubbing his eyes, to relieve himself for the moment from the intolerable
affliction of those swarming eidolons, which, whenever he thought of
this thing or that, thickened about him. They now no longer displaced
one another, but those which came first remained fadedly beside or
behind the fresher appearances, like the earlier rainbow which loses
depth and color when a later arch defines itself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said, glad of the subterfuge. &#8220;They annoy
me a good deal of late.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You want to get fitted for a good pair of glasses. I kept
letting it go, when I first began to get old-sighted.&#8221;</p>

<p>Another lady came to Alford&#8217;s rescue. &#8220;I guess Mr. Alford
has no need to get fitted for old sight yet a while. You got little
spidery things&#8212;specks and dots&#8212;in your eyes?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&#8212;multitudes,&#8221; he said, hopelessly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll tell you what: you want to build up. That was
the way with me, and the oculist said it was from getting all run down.
I built up, and the first thing I knew my sight was as clear as a bell.
You want to build up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You want to go to the mountains,&#8221; a third interposed.
&#8220;That&#8217;s where Mrs. Yarrow&#8217;s gone, and I guess
it&#8217;ll do her more good than sticking it out here would ever have
done.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alford would have been glad enough to go to the mountains, but with
those illusions hovering closer and closer about him, he had no longer
the courage, the strength. He had barely enough of either to get away to
Boston. He found his doctor this time, after winning and losing the
wager he made himself that he would not have returned to town yet, and
the good-fortune was almost too much for his shaken nerves. The cordial
of his friend&#8217;s greeting&#8212;they had been chums at
Harvard&#8212;completed his overthrow. As he sank upon the professional
sofa, where so many other cases had been diagnosticated, he broke into
tears. &#8220;Hello, old fellow!&#8221; the doctor said, encouragingly,
and more tenderly than he would have dealt with some women.
&#8220;What&#8217;s up?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Jim,&#8221; Alford found voice to say, &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid
I&#8217;m losing my mind.&#8221;</p>

<p>The doctor smiled provisionally. &#8220;Well, that&#8217;s
<em>one</em> of the signs you&#8217;re not. Can you say how?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh yes. In a minute,&#8221; Alford sobbed, and when he had got
the better of himself he told his friend the whole story. In the direct
examination he suppressed Mrs. Yarrow&#8217;s part, but when the doctor,
who had listened with smiling seriousness, began to cross-examine him
with the question, &#8220;And you don&#8217;t remember that any outside
influence affected the recurrence of the illusions, or did anything to
prevent it?&#8221; Alford answered promptly: &#8220;Oh yes. There was a
woman who did.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A woman? What sort of a woman?&#8221;</p>

<p>Alford told.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is very curious,&#8221; the doctor said. &#8220;I know a
man who used to have a distressing dream. He broke it up by telling his
wife about it every morning after he had dreamt it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Unluckily, she isn&#8217;t my wife,&#8221; Alford said,
gloomily.</p>

<p>&#8220;But when she was with you, you got rid of the
illusions?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At first, I used to see hers; then I stopped seeing
any.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you ever tell her of them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; I didn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never tell anybody?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No one but you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And do you see them now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think, because you&#8217;ve told me of them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems so.&#8221;</p>

<p>The doctor was silent for a marked space. Then he asked, smiling:
&#8220;Well, why not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell your wife.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How, my wife?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By marriage.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alford looked dazed. &#8220;Do you mean Mrs. Yarrow?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If that&#8217;s her name, and she&#8217;s a widow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And do you think it would be the fair thing for a man on the
verge of insanity&#8212;a physical and mental wreck&#8212;to ask a woman
to marry him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In your case, yes. In the first place, you&#8217;re not so bad
as all that. You need nothing but rest for your body and change for your
mind. I believe you&#8217;ll get rid of your illusions as soon as you
form the habit of speaking of them promptly when they begin to trouble
you. You ought to speak of them to some one. You can&#8217;t always have
me around, and Mrs. Yarrow would be the next best thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s rich, and you know what I am. I&#8217;ll have to
borrow the money to rest on, I&#8217;m so poor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not if you marry it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alford rose, somewhat more vigorously than he had sat down. But that
day he did not go beyond ascertaining that Mrs. Yarrow was in town. He
found out the fact from the maid at her door, who said that she was
nearly always at home after dinner, and, without waiting for the evening
of another day, Alford went to call upon her.</p>

<p>She said, coming down to him in a rather old-fashioned, impersonal
drawing-room which looked distinctly as if it had been left to her:
&#8220;I was so glad to get your card. When did you leave
Woodbeach?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mrs. Yarrow,&#8221; he returned, as if that were the answer,
&#8220;I think I owe you an explanation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pay it!&#8221; she bantered, putting out her hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so poverty-stricken that I don&#8217;t know whether
I can. Did you ever notice anything odd about me?&#8221;</p>

<p>His directness seemed to have a right to directness from her.
&#8220;I noticed that you stared a good deal&#8212;or used to. But
people <em>do</em> stare.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I stared because I saw things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Saw things?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I saw whatever I thought of. Whatever came into my mind was
externated in a vision.&#8221;</p>

<p>She smiled, he could not make out whether uneasily or not. &#8220;It
sounds rather creepy, doesn&#8217;t it? But it&#8217;s very
interesting.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what the doctor said; I&#8217;ve been to see him
this morning. May I tell you about my visions? They&#8217;re not so
creepy as they sound, I believe, and I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;ll
keep you awake.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, do,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I should like of all things
to hear about them. Perhaps I&#8217;ve been one of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! Isn&#8217;t that rather personal?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope not offensively.&#8221;</p>

<p>He went on to tell her, with even greater fulness than he had told
the doctor. She listened with the interest women take in anything weird,
and with a compassion for him which she did not conceal so perfectly but
that he saw it. At the end he said: &#8220;You may wonder that I come to
you with all this, which must sound like the ravings of a
madman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No&#8212;no,&#8221; she hesitated.</p>

<p>&#8220;I came because I wished you to know everything about me
before&#8212;before&#8212;I wouldn&#8217;t have come, you&#8217;ll
believe me, if I hadn&#8217;t had the doctor&#8217;s assurance that my
trouble was merely a part of my being physically out of kilter, and had
nothing to do with my sanity&#8212;Good Heavens! What am I saying? But
the thought has tormented me so! And in the midst of it I&#8217;ve
allowed myself to&#8212;Mrs. Yarrow, I love you. Don&#8217;t you know
that?&#8221;</p>

<p>Alford may have had a divided mind in this declaration, but after
that one word Mrs. Yarrow had no mind for anything else. He went on.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not only sick&#8212;so sick that I
sha&#8217;n&#8217;t be able to do any work for a year at least&#8212;but
I&#8217;m poor, so poor that I can&#8217;t afford to be sick.&#8221;</p>

<p>She lifted her eyes and looked at him, where she sat oddly aloof from
those possessions of hers, to which she seemed so little related, and
said, with a smile quivering at the corners of her pretty mouth,
&#8220;I don&#8217;t see what that has to do with it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; He stared at her hard.</p>

<p>&#8220;Am I in duplicate or triplicate, this time?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, you&#8217;re only one, and there&#8217;s none like you! I
could never see any one else while I looked at you!&#8221; he cried,
only half aware of his poetry, and meaning what he said very
literally.</p>

<p>But she took only the poetry. &#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t wish you
to,&#8221; she said, and she laughed.</p>

<p>He could not believe yet in his good-fortune. His countenance fell.
&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid I don&#8217;t understand, or that you
don&#8217;t. It doesn&#8217;t seem as if I could get to the end of my
unworthiness, which isn&#8217;t voluntary. It seems altogether too base.
I can&#8217;t let you say what you do, if you mean it, till you know
that I come to you in despair as well as in love. You saved me from the
fear I was in, again and again, and I believe that without you I
shall&#8212;Ah, it seems very base! But the doctor&#8212;If I could
always tell some one&#8212;if I could tell <em>you</em> when these
things were obsessing me&#8212;haunting me&#8212;they would
cease&#8212;&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Yarrow rose, with rather a piteous smile. &#8220;Then, I am a
prescription!&#8221; She hoped, woman-like, that she was solely a
passion; but is any woman worth having, ever solely a passion?</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t!&#8221; Alford implored, rising too.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t, in mercy, take it that way! It&#8217;s only that I
wish you to know everything that&#8217;s in me; to know how utterly
helpless and worthless I am. You needn&#8217;t have a pang in throwing
such a thing away.&#8221;</p>

<p>She put out her hand to him, but at arm&#8217;s-length. &#8220;I
sha&#8217;n&#8217;t throw you away&#8212;at least, not to-night. I want
to think.&#8221; It was a way of saying she wished him to go, and he had
no desire to stay. He asked if he might come again, and she said,
&#8220;Oh yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To-morrow?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not to-morrow, perhaps. When I send. Was it <em>young</em>
Doctor Enderby?&#8221;</p>

<p>They had rather a sad, dry parting; and when her door closed upon him
he felt that it had shut him out forever. His shame and his defeat were
so great that he did not think of his eidolons, and they did not come to
trouble him. He woke in the morning, asking himself, bitterly, if he
were cured already. His humiliation was such that he closed his eyes to
the light, and wished he might never again open them to it.</p>

<p>The question that Mrs. Yarrow had to ask Dr. Enderby was not the
question he had instantly forecast for her when she put aside her veil
in his office and told him who she was. She did not seem anxious to be
assured of Alford&#8217;s mental condition, or as to any risks in
marrying him. Her inquiry was much more psychological; it was almost
impersonal, and yet Dr. Enderby thought she looked as if she had been
crying.</p>

<p>She had a difficulty in formulating her question, and when it came it
was almost a speculation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Women,&#8221; she said, a little hoarsely, &#8220;have no
right, I suppose, to expect the ideal in life. The best they can do
seems to be to make the real look like it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dr. Enderby reflected. &#8220;Well, yes. But I don&#8217;t know that
I ever put it to myself in just those terms.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then she remarked, as if that were the next thing:
&#8220;You&#8217;ve known Mr. Alford a long time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We were at school together, and we shared the same rooms in
Harvard.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is very sincere,&#8221; she added, as if this were
relevant.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a man who likes to have a little worse than the
worst known about him. One might say he was excessively sincere.&#8221;
Enderby divined that Alford had been bungling the matter, and he was
willing to help him out if he could.</p>

<p>Mrs. Yarrow fixed dimly beautiful eyes upon him. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
know,&#8221; she said, &#8220;why it wouldn&#8217;t be ideal&#8212;as
much ideal as anything&#8212;to give one&#8217;s self absolutely
to&#8212;to&#8212;a duty&#8212;or not duty, exactly; I don&#8217;t mean
that. Especially,&#8221; she added, showing a light through the mist,
&#8220;if one wanted to do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he knew she had made up her mind, and though on some accounts he
would have liked to laugh with her, on other accounts he felt that he
owed it to her to be serious.</p>

<p>&#8220;If women could not fulfil the ideal in that way&#8212;if they
did not constantly do it&#8212;there would be no marriages for
love.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think so?&#8221; she asked, with a shaking voice.
&#8220;But men&#8212;men are ideal, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not as women are&#8212;except now and then some fool like
Alford.&#8221; Now, indeed, he laughed, and he began to praise Alford
from his heart, so delicately, so tenderly, so reverently, that Mrs.
Yarrow laughed too before he was done, and cried a little, and when she
rose to leave she could not speak; but clung to his hand, on turning
away, and so flung it from behind her with a gesture that Enderby
thought pretty.</p>

<p>At this point, Wanhope stopped as if that were the end.</p>

<p>&#8220;And did she let Alford come to see her again?&#8221; Rulledge,
at once romantic and literal, demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh yes. At any rate, they were married that fall. They
are&#8212;I believe he&#8217;s pursuing his archaeological studies
there&#8212;living in Athens.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Together?&#8221; Minver smoothly inquired.</p>

<p>At this expression of cynicism Rulledge gave him a look that would
have incinerated another. Wanhope went out with Minver, and then, after
a moment&#8217;s daze, Rulledge exclaimed: &#8220;Jove! I forgot to ask
him whether it&#8217;s stopped Alford&#8217;s illusions!&#8221;</p>




<h2><a name="chapter3" id="chapter3">III</a></h2>

<h2 class="chaptertitle">A Memory that Worked Overtime</h2>


<p>Minver&#8217;s brother took down from the top of the low bookshelf a
small painting on panel, which he first studied in the obverse, and then
turned and contemplated on the back with the same dreamy smile. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t see how that got <em>here</em>,&#8221; he said,
absently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; Minver returned, &#8220;you don&#8217;t expect
<em>me</em> to tell you, except on the principle that any one would
naturally know more about anything of yours than you would.&#8221; He
took it from his brother and looked at the front of it. &#8220;It
isn&#8217;t bad. It&#8217;s pretty good!&#8221; He turned it round.
&#8220;Why, it&#8217;s one of old Blakey&#8217;s! How did <em>you</em>
come by it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Stole it, probably,&#8221; Minver&#8217;s brother said, still
thoughtfully. Then with an effect of recollecting: &#8220;No, come to
think of it,&#8221; he added, &#8220;Blakey gave it to me.&#8221; The
Minvers played these little comedies together, quite as much to satisfy
their tenderness for each other as to give their friends pleasure.
&#8220;Think you&#8217;re the only painter that gets me to take his
truck as a gift? He gave it to me, let&#8217;s see, about ten years ago,
when he was trying to make a die of it, and failed; I thought he would
succeed. But it&#8217;s been in my wife&#8217;s room nearly ever since,
and what I can&#8217;t understand is what she&#8217;s doing with it down
here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Probably to make trouble for you, somehow,&#8221; Minver
suggested.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s <em>that</em>,
quite,&#8221; his brother returned, with a false air of scrupulosity,
which was part of their game with each other. He looked some more at the
picture, and then he glanced from it at me. &#8220;There&#8217;s a very
curious story connected with that sketch.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, well, tell it,&#8221; Minver said. &#8220;Tell it! I
suppose I can stand it again. Acton&#8217;s never heard it, I believe.
But you needn&#8217;t make a show of sparing him. I
<em>couldn&#8217;t</em> stand that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I certainly haven&#8217;t heard the story,&#8221; I said,
&#8220;and if I had I would be too polite to own it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Minver&#8217;s brother looked towards the open door over his
shoulder, and Minver interpreted for him: &#8220;She&#8217;s not coming.
I&#8217;ll give you due warning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was before we were married, but not much before, and the
picture was a sort of wedding present for my wife, though Blakey made a
show of giving it to me. Said he had painted it for me, because he had a
prophetic soul, and felt in his bones that I was going to want a picture
of the place where I first met her. You see, it&#8217;s the little villa
her mother had taken that winter on the Viale Petrarca, just outside of
Florence. It <em>was</em> the first place I met her, but not the
last.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be obvious,&#8221; Minver ordered.</p>

<p>His brother did not mind him. &#8220;I thought it was mighty nice of
Blakey. He was barking away, all the time he was talking, and when he
wasn&#8217;t coughing he was so hoarse he could hardly speak above a
whisper; but he kept talking on, and wishing me happy, and fending off
my gratitude, while he was finding a piece of manila paper to wrap the
sketch in, and then hunting for a piece of string to tie it. When he
handed it to me at last, he gasped out: &#8216;I don&#8217;t mind her
knowing that I partly meant it as the place where <em>she</em> first met
<em>you</em>, too. I&#8217;m not ashamed of it as a bit of color.
Anyway, I sha&#8217;n&#8217;t live to do anything better.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Oh, yes, you will,&#8217; I came back in that lying way
we think is kind with dying people. I suppose it is; anyway, it turned
out all right with Blakey, as he&#8217;ll testify if you look him up
when you go to Florence. By the way, he lives in that villa
<em>now</em>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No?&#8221; I said. &#8220;How charming!&#8221;</p>

<p>Minver&#8217;s brother went on: &#8220;I made up my mind to be
awfully careful of that picture, and not let it out of my hand till I
left it with &#8216;her&#8217; mother, to be put among the other wedding
presents that were accumulating at their house in Exeter Street. So I
held it on my lap going in by train from Lexington, where Blakey lived,
and when I got out at the old Lowell Depot&#8212;North Station,
now&#8212;and got into the little tinkle-tankle horse-car that took me
up to where I was to get the Back Bay car&#8212;Those were the
prehistoric times before trolleys, and there were odds in horse-cars. We
considered the blue-painted Back Bay cars very swell. <em>You</em>
remember them?&#8221; he asked Minver.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not when I can help it,&#8221; Minver answered. &#8220;When I
broke with Boston, and went to New York, I burnt my horse-cars behind
me, and never wanted to know what they looked like, one from
another.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, as I was saying,&#8221; Minver&#8217;s brother went on,
without regarding his impatriotism, &#8220;when I got into the horse-car
at the depot, I rushed for a corner seat, and I put the picture, with
its face next the car-end, between me and the wall, and kept my hand on
it; and when I changed to the Back Bay car, I did the same thing. There
was a florist&#8217;s just there, and I couldn&#8217;t resist some
Mayflowers in the window; I was in that condition, you know, when
flowers seemed to be made for her, and I had to take her own to her
wherever I found them. I put the bunch between my knees, and kept one
hand on it, while I kept my other hand on the picture at my side. I was
feeling first-rate, and when General Filbert got in after we started,
and stood before me hanging by a strap and talking down to me, I had the
decency to propose giving him my seat, as he was about ten years
older.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure?&#8221; Minver asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, say fifteen. I don&#8217;t pretend to be a chicken, and
never did. But he wouldn&#8217;t hear of it. Said I had a bundle, and
winked at the bunch of Mayflowers. We had such a jolly talk that I let
the car carry me a block by and had to get out at Gloucester and run
back to Exeter. I rang, and, when the maid came to the door, there I
stood with nothing but the Mayflowers in my hand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good <i>coup de th&#233;&#226;tre</i>,&#8221; Minver jeered.
&#8220;Curtain?&#8221;</p>

<p>His brother disdained reply, or was too much absorbed in his tale to
think of any. &#8220;When the girl opened the door and I discovered my
fix I burst out, &#8216;Good Lord!&#8217; and I stuck the bunch of
flowers at her, and turned and ran. I suppose I must have had some
notion of overtaking the car with my picture in it. But the best I could
do was to let the next one overtake me several blocks down Marlborough
Street, and carry me to the little jumping-off station on Westchester
Park, as we used to call it in those days, at the end of the Back Bay
line.</p>

<p>&#8220;As I pushed into the railroad office, I bet myself that the
picture would not be there, and, sure enough, I won.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You were always a lucky dog,&#8221; Minver said.</p>

<p>&#8220;But the man in charge was very encouraging, and said it was
sure to be turned in; and he asked me what time the car had passed the
corner of Gloucester Street. I happened to know, and then he said, Oh
yes, that conductor was a substitute, and he wouldn&#8217;t be on again
till morning; then he would be certain to bring the picture with him. I
was not to worry, for it would be all right. Nothing left in the Back
Bay cars was ever lost; the character of the abutters was guarantee for
that, and they were practically the only passengers. The conductors and
the drivers were as honest as the passengers, and I could consider
myself in the hands of friends.</p>

<p>&#8220;He was so reassuring that I went away smiling at my fears, and
promising to be round bright and early, as soon, the official
suggested&#8212;the morrow being Sunday&#8212;as soon as the men and
horses had had their baked beans.</p>

<p>&#8220;Still, after dinner, I had a lurking anxiety, which I turned
into a friendly impulse to go and call on Mrs. Filbert, whom I really
owed a bread-and-butter visit, and who, I knew, would not mind my coming
in the evening. The general, she said, had been telling her of our
pleasant chat in the car, and would be glad to smoke his after-dinner
cigar with me, and why wouldn&#8217;t I come into the library?</p>

<p>&#8220;We were so very jolly together, all three, that I made light
of my misadventure about the picture. The general inquired about the
flowers first. He remembered the flowers perfectly, and hoped they were
acceptable; he thought he remembered the picture, too, now I mentioned
it; but he would not have noticed it so much, there by my side, with my
hand on it. I would be sure to get it. He gave several instances,
personal to him and his friends, of recoveries of lost articles; it was
really astonishing how careful the horse-car people were, especially on
the Back Bay line. I would find my picture all right at the Westchester
Park station in the morning; never fear.</p>

<p>&#8220;I feared so little that I slept well, and even overslept; and
I went to get my picture quite confidently, and I could hardly believe
it had not been turned in yet, though the station-master told me so. The
substitute conductor had not seen it, but more than likely it was at the
stables, where the cleaners would have found it in the car and turned it
in. He was as robustly cheerful about it as ever, and offered to send an
inquiry by the next car; but I said, Why shouldn&#8217;t I go myself;
and he said that was a good idea. So I went, and it was well I did, for
my picture was not there, and I had saved time by going. It was not
there, but the head man said I need not worry a mite about it; I was
certain to get it sooner or later; it would be turned in, to a dead
certainty. We became rather confidential, and I went so far as to
explain about wanting to make my inquiries very quietly on
Blakey&#8217;s account: he would be annoyed if he heard of its loss, and
it might react unfavorably on his health.</p>

<p>&#8220;The head man said that was so; and he would tell me what I
wanted to do: I wanted to go to the Company&#8217;s General Offices in
Milk Street, and tell them about it. That was where everything went as a
last resort, and he would bet any money that I would see my picture
there the first thing I got inside the door. I thanked him with the
fervor I thought he merited, and said I would go at once.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Well,&#8217; he said, &#8216;you don&#8217;t want to go
to-day, you know. The offices are not open Sunday. And to-morrow&#8217;s
a holiday. But you&#8217;re all right. You&#8217;ll find your picture
there, don&#8217;t you have any doubts about it.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;That was my next to last Sunday supper with my wife, before
she became my wife, at her mother&#8217;s house, and I went to the feast
with as little gayety as I suppose any young man ever carried to a
supper of the kind. I was told, afterwards, that my behavior up to a
certain point was so suggestive either of secret crime or of secret
regret, that the only question was whether they should have in the
police or I should be given back my engagement ring and advised to go.
Luckily I ceased to bear my anguish just in time.</p>

<p>&#8220;The fact is, I could not stand it any longer, and as soon as I
was alone with her I made a clean breast of it; partially clean, that
is: I suppose a fellow never tells <em>all</em> to a girl, if he truly
loves her.&#8221; Minver&#8217;s brother glanced round at us and
gathered the harvest of our approving smiles. &#8220;I said to her,
&#8216;I&#8217;ve been having a wedding present.&#8217;
&#8216;Well,&#8217; she said, &#8216;you&#8217;ve come as near having no
use for a wedding present as anybody <em>I</em> know. Was having a
wedding present what made you so gloomy at supper? Who gave it to you,
anyway?&#8217; &#8216;Old Blakey.&#8217; &#8216;A painting?&#8217;
&#8216;Yes&#8212;a sketch.&#8217; &#8216;What of?&#8217; This was where
I qualified. I said: &#8216;Oh, just one of those Sorrento things of
his.&#8217; You see, if I told her that it was the villa where we first
met, and then said I had left it in the horse-car, she would take it as
proof positive that I did not really care anything about her or I never
could have forgotten it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You were wise as far as you went,&#8221; Minver said.
&#8220;Go on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I told her the whole story circumstantially: how I had
kept the sketch religiously in my lap in the train, and then held it
down with my hand all the while beside me in the first horse-car, and
did the same thing in the Back Bay car I changed to; and felt of it the
whole time I was talking with General Filbert, and then left it there
when I got out to leave the flowers at her door, when the awful fact
came over me like a flash. &#8216;Yes,&#8217; she said, &#8216;Norah
said you poked the flowers at her without a word, and she had to guess
they were for me.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;I had got my story pretty glib by this time; I had reeled it
off with increasing particulars to the Westchester Park station-master,
and the head man at the stables, and General Filbert, and I was so
letter-perfect that I had a vision of the whole thing, especially of my
talking with the general while I kept my hand on the picture&#8212;and
then all was dark.</p>

<p>&#8220;At the end she said we must advertise for the picture. I said
it would kill Blakey if he saw it; and she said: No matter, <em>let</em>
it kill him; it would show him that we valued his gift, and were moving
heaven and earth to find it; and, at any rate, it would kill <em>me</em>
if I kept myself in suspense. I said I should not care for that; but
with her sympathy I guessed I could live through the night, and I was
sure I should find the thing at the Milk Street office in the
morning.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Why,&#8217; said she, &#8216;to-morrow it&#8217;ll be
shut!&#8217; and then I didn&#8217;t really know what to say, and I
agreed to drawing up an advertisement then and there, so as not to lose
an instant&#8217;s time after I had been at the Milk Street office on
Tuesday and found the picture had not been turned in. She said I could
dictate the advertisement and she would write it down, and she asked:
&#8216;Which one of his Sorrento things was it? You must describe it
exactly, you know.&#8217; That made me feel awfully, and I said I was
not going to have my next-to-last Sunday evening with her spoiled by
writing advertisements; and I got away, somehow, with all sorts of
comforting reassurances from her. I could see that she was feigning them
to encourage me.</p>

<p>&#8220;The next morning, I simply could not keep away from the Milk
Street office, and my unreasonable impatience was rewarded by finding it
at least ajar, if not open. There was the nicest kind of a young fellow
there, and he said he was not officially present; but what could he do
for me? Then I told him the whole story, with details I had not thought
of before; and he was just as enthusiastic about my getting my picture
as the Westchester Park station-master or the head man of the stables.
It was morally certain to be turned in, the first thing in the morning;
but he would take a description of it, and send out inquiries to all the
conductors and drivers and car-cleaners, and make a special thing of it.
He entered into the spirit of the affair, and I felt that I had such a
friend in him that I confided a little more and hinted at the double
interest I had in the picture. I didn&#8217;t pretend that it was one of
Blakey&#8217;s Sorrento things, but I gave him a full and true
description of it, with its length, breadth, and thickness, in exact
measure.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here Minver&#8217;s brother stopped and lost himself in contemplation
of the sketch, as he held it at arm&#8217;s-length.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, did you get your picture?&#8221; I prompted, after a
moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh yes,&#8221; he said, with a quick turn towards me.
&#8220;This is it. A District Messenger brought it round the first thing
Tuesday morning. He brought it,&#8221; Minver&#8217;s brother added,
with a certain effectiveness, &#8220;from the florist&#8217;s, where I
had stopped to get those Mayflowers. I had left it there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve told it very well, this time, Joe,&#8221; Minver
said. &#8220;But Acton here is waiting for the psychology. Poor old
Wanhope ought to be here,&#8221; he added to me. He looked about for a
match to light his pipe, and his brother jerked his head in the
direction of the chimney.</p>

<p>&#8220;Box on the mantel. Yes,&#8221; he sighed, &#8220;that was
really something very curious. You see, I had invented the whole history
of the case from the time I got into the Back Bay car with my flowers.
Absolutely nothing had happened of all I had remembered till I got out
of the car. I did not put the picture beside me at the end of the car; I
did not keep my hand on it while I talked with General Filbert; I did
not leave it behind me when I left the car. Nothing of the kind
happened. I had already left it at the florist&#8217;s, and that whole
passage of experience which was so vividly and circumstantially stamped
in my memory that I related it four or five times over, and would have
made oath to every detail of it, was pure invention, or, rather, it was
something less positive: the reflex of the first half of my horse-car
experience, when I really did put the picture in the corner next me, and
did keep my hand on it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very strange,&#8221; I was beginning, but just then the door
opened and Mrs. Minver came in, and I was presented.</p>

<p>She gave me a distracted hand, as she said to her husband:
&#8220;Have you been telling the story about that picture again?&#8221;
He was still holding it. &#8220;Silly!&#8221;</p>

<p>She was a mighty pretty woman, but full of vim and fun and sense.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s one of the most curious freaks of memory I ever
heard of, Mrs. Minver,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>Then she showed that she was proud of it, though she had called him
silly. &#8220;Have you told,&#8221; she demanded of her husband,
&#8220;how oddly your memory behaved about the subject of the picture,
too?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have again eaten that particular piece of humble-pie,&#8221;
Minver&#8217;s brother replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; she said to me, &#8220;<em>I</em> think he was
simply so possessed with the awfulness of having lost the picture that
all the rest took place prophetically, but unconsciously.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By a species of inverted presentiment?&#8221; I suggested.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she assented, slowly, as if the formulation were
new to her, but not unacceptable. &#8220;Something of that kind. I never
heard of anybody else having it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Minver had got his pipe alight, and was enjoying it.
&#8220;<em>I</em> think Joe was simply off his nut, for the time
being.&#8221;</p>




<h2><a name="chapter4" id="chapter4">IV</a></h2>

<h2 class="chaptertitle">A Case of Metaphantasmia</h2>


<p>The stranger was a guest of Halson&#8217;s, and Halson himself was a
comparative stranger, for he was of recent election to our dining-club,
and was better known to Minver than to the rest of our little group,
though one could not be sure that he was very well known to Minver. The
stranger had been dining with Halson, and we had found the two smoking
together, with their cups of black coffee at their elbows, before the
smouldering fire in the Turkish room when we came in from
dinner&#8212;my friend Wanhope the psychologist, Rulledge the
sentimentalist, Minver the painter, and myself. It struck me for the
first time that a fire on the hearth was out of keeping with a Turkish
room, but I felt that the cups of black coffee restored the lost balance
in some measure.</p>

<p>Before we had settled into our wonted places&#8212;in fact, almost as
we entered&#8212;Halson looked over his shoulder and said: &#8220;Mr.
Wanhope, I want you to hear this story of my friend&#8217;s. Go on,
Newton&#8212;or, rather, go back and begin again&#8212;and I&#8217;ll
introduce you afterwards.&#8221;</p>

<p>The stranger made a becoming show of deprecation. He said he did not
think the story would bear immediate repetition, or was even worth
telling once, but, if we had nothing better to do, perhaps we might do
worse than hear it; the most he could say for it was that the thing
really happened. He wore a large, drooping, gray mustache, which, with
the imperial below it, quite hid his mouth, and gave him, somehow, a
martial effect, besides accurately dating him of the period between the
latest sixties and earliest seventies, when his beard would have been
black; I liked his mustache not being stubbed in the modern manner, but
allowed to fall heavily over his lips, and then branch away from the
corners of his mouth as far as it would. He lighted the cigar which
Halson gave him, and, blowing the bitten-off tip towards the fire,
began:</p>

<p>&#8220;It was about that time when we first had a ten-o&#8217;clock
night train from Boston to New York. Train used to start at nine, and
lag along round by Springfield, and get into the old Twenty-sixth Street
Station here at six in the morning, where they let you sleep as long as
you liked. They call you up now at half-past five, and, if you
don&#8217;t turn out, they haul you back to Mott Haven, or New Haven,
I&#8217;m not sure which. I used to go into Boston and turn in at the
old Worcester Depot, as we called it then, just about the time the train
began to move, and I usually got a fine night&#8217;s rest in the course
of the nine or ten hours we were on the way to New York; it didn&#8217;t
seem quite the same after we began saying Albany Depot: shortened up the
run, somehow.</p>

<div class="illustration"><a href="images/illust4l.jpg" name="illust4"><img src="images/illust4m.jpg" title="&#8220;NO BURGLAR COULD HAVE MISSED ME IF HE HAD WANTED AN EASY MARK&#8221;" alt="[Illustration: &#8220;NO BURGLAR COULD HAVE MISSED ME IF HE HAD WANTED AN EASY MARK&#8221;]" style="width: 300px; height: 709px" /></a></div>

<p>&#8220;But that night I wasn&#8217;t very sleepy, and the porter had
got the place so piping hot with the big stoves, one at each end of the
car, to keep the good, old-fashioned Christmas cold out, that I thought
I should be more comfortable with a smoke before I went to bed; and,
anyhow, I could get away from the heat better in the smoking-room. I
hated to be leaving home on Christmas Eve, for I never had done that
before, and I hated to be leaving my wife alone with the children and
the two girls in our little house in Cambridge. Before I started in on
the old horse-car for Boston, I had helped her to tuck the young ones in
and to fill the stockings hung along the wall over the
register&#8212;the nearest we could come to a fireplace&#8212;and I
thought those stockings looked very weird, five of them, dangling
lumpily down, and I kept seeing them, and her sitting up sewing in front
of them, and afraid to go to bed on account of burglars. I suppose she
was shyer of burglars than any woman ever was that had never seen a sign
of them. She was always calling me up, to go down-stairs and put them
out, and I used to wander all over the house, from attic to cellar, in
my nighty, with a lamp in one hand and a poker in the other, so that no
burglar could have missed me if he had wanted an easy mark. I always
kept a lamp and a poker handy.&#8221;</p>

<p>The stranger heaved a sigh as of fond reminiscence, and looked round
for the sympathy which in our company of bachelors he failed of; even
the sympathetic Rulledge failed of the necessary experience to move him
in compassionate response.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; the stranger went on, a little damped perhaps by
his failure, but supported apparently by the interest of the fact in
hand, &#8220;I had the smoking-room to myself for a while, and then a
fellow put his head in that I thought I knew after I had thought I
didn&#8217;t know him. He dawned on me more and more, and I had to
acknowledge to myself, by and by, that it was a man named Melford, whom
I used to room with in Holworthy at Harvard; that is, we had an
apartment of two bedrooms and a study; and I suppose there were never
two fellows knew less of each other than we did at the end of our four
years together. I can&#8217;t say what Melford knew of me, but the most
I knew of Melford was his particular brand of nightmare.&#8221;</p>

<p>Wanhope gave the first sign of his interest in the matter. He took
his cigar from his lips, and softly emitted an &#8220;Ah!&#8221;</p>

<p>Rulledge went further and interrogatively repeated the word
&#8220;Nightmare?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nightmare,&#8221; the stranger continued, firmly. &#8220;The
curious thing about it was that I never exactly knew the subject of his
nightmare, and a more curious thing yet was Melford himself never knew
it, when I woke him up. He said he couldn&#8217;t make out anything but
a kind of scraping in a door-lock. His theory was that in his childhood
it had been a much completer thing, but that the circumstances had
broken down in a sort of decadence, and now there was nothing left of it
but that scraping in the door-lock, like somebody trying to turn a
misfit key. I used to throw things at his door, and once I tried a
cold-water douche from the pitcher, when he was very hard to waken; but
that was rather brutal, and after a while I used to let him roar himself
awake; he would always do it, if I trusted to nature; and before our
junior year was out I got so that I could sleep through, pretty calmly;
I would just say to myself when he fetched me to the surface with a
yell, &#8216;That&#8217;s Melford dreaming,&#8217; and doze off
sweetly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Jove!&#8221; Rulledge said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t see how you
could stand it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s everything in habit, Rulledge,&#8221; Minver put
in. &#8220;Perhaps our friend only dreamt that he heard a
dream.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s quite possible,&#8221; the stranger owned,
politely. &#8220;But the case is superficially as I state it. However,
it was all past, long ago, when I recognized Melford in the smoking-room
that night: it must have been ten or a dozen years. I was wearing a full
beard then, and so was he; we wore as much beard as we could in those
days. I had been through the war since college, and he had been in
California, most of the time, and, as he told me, he had been up north,
in Alaska, just after we bought it, and hurt his eyes&#8212;had
snow-blindness&#8212;and he wore spectacles. In fact, I had to do most
of the recognizing, but after we found out who we were we were rather
comfortable; and I liked him better than I remembered to have liked him
in our college days. I don&#8217;t suppose there was ever much harm in
him; it was only my grudge about his nightmare. We talked along and
smoked along for about an hour, and I could hear the porter outside,
making up the berths, and the train rumbled away towards Framingham, and
then towards Worcester, and I began to be sleepy, and to think I would
go to bed myself; and just then the door of the smoking-room opened, and
a young girl put in her face a moment, and said: &#8216;Oh, I beg your
pardon. I thought it was the stateroom,&#8217; and then she shut the
door, and I realized that she looked like a girl I used to
know.&#8221;</p>

<p>The stranger stopped, and I fancied from a note in his voice that
this girl was perhaps like an early love. We silently waited for him to
resume how and when he would. He sighed, and after an appreciable
interval he began again. &#8220;It is curious how things are related to
one another. My wife had never seen her, and yet, somehow, this girl
that looked like the one I mean brought my mind back to my wife with a
quick turn, after I had forgotten her in my talk with Melford for the
time being. I thought how lonely she was in that little house of ours in
Cambridge, on rather an outlying street, and I knew she was thinking of
me, and hating to have me away on Christmas Eve, which isn&#8217;t such
a lively time after you&#8217;re grown up and begin to look back on a
good many other Christmas Eves, when you were a child yourself; in fact,
I don&#8217;t know a dismaler night in the whole year. I stepped out on
the platform before I began to turn in, for a mouthful of the night air,
and I found it was spitting snow&#8212;a regular Christmas Eve of the
true pattern; and I didn&#8217;t believe, from the business feel of
those hard little pellets, that it was going to stop in a hurry, and I
thought if we got into New York on time we should be lucky. The snow
made me think of a night when my wife was sure there were burglars in
the house; and in fact I heard their tramping on the stairs
myself&#8212;thump, thump, thump, and then a stop, and then down again.
Of course it was the slide and thud of the snow from the roof of the
main part of the house to the roof of the kitchen, which was in an L, a
story lower, but it was as good an imitation of burglars as I want to
hear at one o&#8217;clock in the morning; and the recollection of it
made me more anxious about my wife, not because I believed she was in
danger, but because I knew how frightened she must be.</p>

<p>&#8220;When I went back into the car, that girl passed me on the way
to her stateroom, and I concluded that she was the only woman on board,
and her friends had taken the stateroom for her, so that she
needn&#8217;t feel strange. I usually go to bed in a sleeper as I do in
my own house, but that night I somehow couldn&#8217;t. I got to thinking
of accidents, and I thought how disagreeable it would be to turn out
into the snow in my nighty. I ended by turning in with my clothes on,
all except my coat; and, in spite of the red-hot stoves, I wasn&#8217;t
any too warm. I had a berth in the middle of the car, and just as I was
parting my curtains to lie down, old Melford came to take the lower
berth opposite. It made me laugh a little, and I was glad of the relief.
&#8216;Why, hello, Melford,&#8217; said I. &#8216;This is like the old
Holworthy times.&#8217; &#8216;Yes, isn&#8217;t it?&#8217; said he, and
then I asked something that I had kept myself from asking all through
our talk in the smoking-room, because I knew he was rather sensitive
about it, or used to be. &#8216;Do you ever have that regulation
nightmare of yours nowadays, Melford? He gave a laugh, and said:
&#8217;I haven&#8217;t had it, I suppose, once in ten years. What made
you think of it?&#8217; I said: &#8216;Oh, I don&#8217;t know. It just
came into my mind. Well, good-night, old fellow. I hope you&#8217;ll
rest well,&#8217; and suddenly I began to feel light-hearted again, and
I went to sleep as gayly as ever I did in my life.&#8221;</p>

<p>The stranger paused again, and Wanhope said: &#8220;Those swift
transitions of mood are very interesting. Of course they occur in that
remote region of the mind where all incidents and sensations are of one
quality, and things of the most opposite character unite in a common
origin. No one that I remember has attempted to trace such effects to
their causes, and then back again from their causes, which would be much
more important.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I dare say,&#8221; Minver put in. &#8220;But if they all
amount to the same thing in the end, what difference would it
make?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It would perhaps establish the identity of good and
evil,&#8221; Wanhope suggested.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, the sinners are convinced of that already,&#8221; Minver
said, while Rulledge glanced quickly from one to the other.</p>

<p>The stranger looked rather dazed, and Rulledge said: &#8220;Well, I
don&#8217;t suppose that was the conclusion of the whole
matter?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh no,&#8221; the stranger answered, &#8220;that was only the
beginning of the conclusion. I didn&#8217;t go to sleep at once, though
I felt so much at peace. In fact, Melford beat me, and I could hear him
far in advance, steaming and whistling away, in a style that I recalled
as characteristic, over a space of intervening years that I hadn&#8217;t
definitely summed up yet. It made me think of a night near Narragansett
Bay, where two friends of mine and I had had a mighty good dinner at a
sort of wild club-house, and had hurried into our bunks, each one so as
to get the start of the others, for the fellows that were left behind
knew they had no chance of sleep after the first began to get in his
work. I laughed, and I suppose I must have gone to sleep almost
simultaneously, for I don&#8217;t recollect anything afterwards till I
was wakened by a kind of muffled bellow, that I remembered only too
well. It was the unfailing sign of Melford&#8217;s nightmare.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was ready to swear, and I was ashamed for the fellow who had
no more self-control than that: when a fellow snores, or has a
nightmare, you always think first off that he needn&#8217;t have had it
if he had tried. As usual, I knew Melford didn&#8217;t know what his
nightmare was about, and that made me madder still, to have him
bellowing into the air like that, with no particular aim. All at once
there came a piercing scream from the stateroom, and then I knew that
the girl there had heard Melford and been scared out of a year&#8217;s
growth.&#8221;</p>

<p>The stranger made a little break, and Wanhope asked, &#8220;Could you
make out what she screamed, or was it quite inarticulate?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was plain enough, and it gave me a clew, somehow, to what
Melford&#8217;s nightmare was about. She was calling out, &#8216;Help!
help! help! Burglars!&#8217; till I thought she would raise the roof of
the car.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And did she wake anybody?&#8221; Rulledge inquired.</p>

<p>&#8220;That was the strange part of it. Not a soul stirred, and after
the first burst the girl seemed to quiet down again and yield the floor
to Melford, who kept bellowing steadily away. I was so furious that I
reached out across the aisle to shake him, but the attempt was too much
for me. I lost my balance and fell out of my berth onto the floor. You
may imagine the state of mind I was in. I gathered myself up and pulled
Melford&#8217;s curtains open and was just going to fall on him tooth
and nail, when I was nearly taken off my feet again by an apparition:
well, it looked like an apparition, but it was a tall fellow in his
nighty&#8212;for it was twenty years before pajamas&#8212;and he had a
small dark lantern in his hand, such as we used to carry in those days
so as to read in our berths when we couldn&#8217;t sleep. He was
gritting his teeth, and growling between them: &#8216;Out o&#8217; this!
Out o&#8217; this! I&#8217;m going to shoot to kill, you blasted
thieves!&#8217; I could see by the strange look in his eyes that he was
sleep-walking, and I didn&#8217;t wait to see if he had a pistol. I
popped in behind the curtains, and found myself on top of another
fellow, for I had popped into the wrong berth in my confusion. The man
started up and yelled: &#8216;Oh, don&#8217;t kill me! There&#8217;s my
watch on the stand, and all the money in the house is in my pantaloons
pocket. The silver&#8217;s in the sideboard down-stairs, and it&#8217;s
plated, anyway.&#8217; Then I understood what his complaint was, and I
rolled onto the floor again. By that time every man in the car was out
of his berth, too, except Melford, who was devoting himself strictly to
business; and every man was grabbing some other, and shouting,
&#8216;Police!&#8217; or &#8216;Burglars!&#8217; or &#8216;Help!&#8217;
or &#8216;Murder!&#8217; just as the fancy took him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Most extraordinary!&#8221; Wanhope commented as the stranger
paused for breath.</p>

<p>In the intensity of our interest, we had crowded close upon him,
except Minver, who sat with his head thrown back, and that cynical cast
in his eye which always exasperated Rulledge; and Halson, who stood
smiling proudly, as if the stranger&#8217;s story did him as his sponsor
credit personally.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; the stranger owned, &#8220;but I don&#8217;t know
that there wasn&#8217;t something more extraordinary still. From time to
time the girl in the stateroom kept piping up, with a shriek for help.
She had got past the burglar stage, but she wanted to be saved, anyhow,
from some danger which she didn&#8217;t specify. It went through me that
it was very strange nobody called the porter, and I set up a shout of
&#8216;Porter!&#8217; on my own account. I decided that if there were
burglars the porter was the man to put them out, and that if there were
no burglars the porter could relieve our groundless fears. Sure enough,
he came rushing in, as soon as I called for him, from the little corner
by the smoking-room where he was blacking boots between dozes. He was
wide enough awake, if having his eyes open meant that, and he had a shoe
on one hand and a shoe-brush in the other. But he merely joined in the
general up-roar and shouted for the police.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Excuse me,&#8221; Wanhope interposed. &#8220;I wish to be
clear as to the facts. You had reasoned it out that the porter could
quiet the tumult?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never reasoned anything out so clearly in my life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But what was your theory of the situation? That your friend,
Mr. Melford, had a nightmare in which he was dreaming of
burglars?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hadn&#8217;t a doubt of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And that by a species of dream-transference the
nightmare was communicated to the young lady in the
stateroom?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well&#8212;yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And that her call for help and her cry of burglars acted as a
sort of hypnotic suggestion with the other sleepers, and they began to
be afflicted with the same nightmare?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know that I ever put it to myself so distinctly,
but it appears to me now that I must have reached some such
conclusion.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is very interesting, very interesting indeed. I beg your
pardon. Please go on,&#8221; Wanhope courteously entreated.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t remember just where I was,&#8221; the stranger
faltered.</p>

<p>Rulledge returned with an accuracy which obliged us all:
&#8220;&#8216;The porter merely joined in the general uproar and shouted
for the police.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh yes,&#8221; the stranger assented. &#8220;Then I
didn&#8217;t know what to do, for a minute. The porter was a pretty
thick-headed darky, but he was lion-hearted; and his idea was to lay
hold of a burglar wherever he could find him. There were plenty of
burglars in the aisle there, or people that were afraid of burglars, and
they seemed to think the porter had a good idea. They had hold of one
another already, and now began to pull up and down the aisles in a way
that reminded me of the old-fashioned mesmeric lecturers, when they told
their subjects that they were this or that, and set them to acting the
part. I remembered how once when the mesmerist gave out that they were
at a horse&#8212;race, and his subjects all got astride of their chairs,
and galloped up and down the hall like a lot of little boys on laths. I
thought of that now, and although it was rather a serious business, for
I didn&#8217;t know what minute they would come to blows, I
couldn&#8217;t help laughing. The sight was weird enough. Every one
looked like a somnambulist as he pulled and hauled. The young lady in
the stateroom was doing her full share. She was screaming,
&#8216;Won&#8217;t somebody let me out?&#8217; and hammering on the
door. I guess it was her screaming and hammering that brought the
conductor at last, or maybe he just came round in the course of nature
to take up the tickets. It was before the time when they took the
tickets at the gate, and you used to stick them into a little slot at
the side of your berth, and the conductor came along and took them in
the night, somewhere between Worcester and Springfield, I should
say.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I remember,&#8221; Rulledge assented, but very carefully, so
as not to interrupt the flow of the narrative. &#8220;Used to wake up
everybody in the car.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Exactly,&#8221; the stranger said. &#8220;But this time they
were all wide awake to receive him, or fast asleep, and dreaming their
roles. He came along with the wire of his lantern over his arm, the way
the old-time conductors did, and calling out, &#8216;Tickets!&#8217;
just as if it was broad day, and he believed every man was trying to
beat his way to New York. The oddest thing about it was that the
sleep-walkers all stopped their pulling and hauling a moment, and each
man reached down to the little slot alongside of his berth and handed
over his ticket. Then they took hold and began pulling and hauling
again. I suppose the conductor asked what the matter was; but I
couldn&#8217;t hear him, and I couldn&#8217;t make out exactly what he
did say. But the passengers understood, and they all shouted
&#8216;Burglars!&#8217; and that girl in the stateroom gave a shriek
that you could have heard from one end of the train to the other, and
hammered on the door, and wanted to be let out.</p>

<p>&#8220;It seemed to take the conductor by surprise, and he faced
towards the stateroom and let the lantern slip off his arm, and it
dropped onto the floor and went out; I remember thinking what a good
thing it didn&#8217;t set the car on fire. But there in the
dark&#8212;for the car lamps went out at the same time with the
lantern&#8212;I could hear those fellows pulling and hauling up and down
the aisle and scuffling over the floor, and through all Melford
bellowing away, like an orchestral accompaniment to a combat in Wagner
opera, but getting quieter and quieter till his bellow died away
altogether. At the same time the row in the aisle of the car stopped,
and there was perfect silence, and I could hear the snow rattling
against my window. Then I went off into a sound sleep, and never woke
till we got into New York.&#8221;</p>

<p>The stranger seemed to have reached the end of his story, or at least
to have exhausted the interest it had for him, and he smoked on, holding
his knee between his hands and looking thoughtfully into the fire.</p>

<p>He had left us rather breathless, or, better said, blank, and each
looked at the other for some initiative; then we united in looking at
Wanhope; that is, Rulledge and I did. Minver rose and stretched himself
with what I must describe as a sardonic yawn; Halson had stolen away
before the end, as one to whom the end was known. Wanhope seemed by no
means averse to the inquiry delegated to him, but only to be formulating
its terms. At last he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t remember hearing of any case of this kind
before. Thought-transference is a sufficiently ascertained
phenomenon&#8212;the insistence of a conscious mind upon a certain fact
until it penetrates the unconscious mind of another and is adopted as
its own. But in the dream state the mind seems passive, and becomes the
prey of this or that self-suggestion, without the power of imparting it
to another dreaming mind. Yet here we have positive proof of such an
effect. It appears that the victim of a particularly terrific nightmare
was able to share its horrors&#8212;or rather unable <em>not</em> to
share them&#8212;with a whole sleeping-car full of people whose brains
helplessly took up the same theme, and dreamed it, as we may say, to the
same conclusions. I said proof, but of course we can&#8217;t accept a
single instance as establishing a scientific certainty. I don&#8217;t
question the veracity of Mr.&#8212;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Newton,&#8221; the stranger suggested.</p>

<p>&#8220;Newton&#8217;s experience,&#8221; Wanhope continued,
&#8220;but we must wait for a good many cases of the kind before we can
accept what I may call metaphantasmia as being equally established with
thought-transference. If we could it would throw light upon a whole
series of most curious phenomena, as, for instance, the privity of a
person dreamed about to the incident created by the dreamer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That would be rather dreadful, wouldn&#8217;t it?&#8221; I
ventured. &#8220;We do dream such scandalous, such compromising things
about people.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All that,&#8221; Wanhope gently insisted, &#8220;could have
nothing to do with the fact. That alone is to be considered in an
inquiry of the kind. One is never obliged to tell one&#8217;s dreams. I
wonder&#8221;&#8212;he turned to the stranger, who sat absently staring
into the fire&#8212;&#8220;if you happened to speak to your friend about
his nightmare in the morning, and whether he was by any chance aware of
the participation of the others in it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I certainly spoke to him pretty plainly when we got into New
York.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what did he say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He said he had never slept better in his life, and he
couldn&#8217;t remember having a trace of nightmare. He said he heard
<em>me</em> groaning at one time, but I stopped just as he woke, and so
he didn&#8217;t rouse me as he thought of doing. It was at Hartford, and
he went to sleep again, and slept through without a break.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what was your conclusion from that?&#8221; Wanhope
asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;That he was lying, I should say,&#8221; Rulledge replied for
the stranger.</p>

<p>Wanhope still waited, and the stranger said, &#8220;I suppose one
conclusion might be that I had dreamed the whole thing
myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you wish me to infer,&#8221; the psychologist pursued,
&#8220;that the entire incident was a figment of your sleeping brain?
That there was no sort of sleeping thought-transference, no
metaphantasmia, no&#8212;Excuse me. Do you remember verifying your
impression of being between Worcester and Springfield when the affair
occurred, by looking at your watch, for instance?&#8221;</p>

<p>The stranger suddenly pulled out his watch at the word. &#8220;Good
Heavens!&#8221; he called out. &#8220;It&#8217;s twenty minutes of
eleven, and I have to take the eleven-o&#8217;clock train to Boston. I
must bid you good-evening, gentlemen. I&#8217;ve just time to get it if
I can catch a cab. Good-night, good-night. I hope if you come to
Boston&#8212;eh&#8212;Good-night! Sometimes,&#8221; he called over his
shoulder, &#8220;I&#8217;ve thought it might have been that girl in the
stateroom that started the dreaming.&#8221;</p>

<p>He had wrung our hands one after another, and now he ran out of the
room.</p>

<p>Rulledge said, in appeal to Wanhope: &#8220;I don&#8217;t see how his
being the dreamer invalidates the case, if his dreams affected the
others.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; Wanhope answered, thoughtfully, &#8220;that
depends.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what do you think of its being the girl in the
stateroom?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That would be very interesting.&#8221;</p>




<h2><a name="chapter5" id="chapter5">V</a></h2>

<h2 class="chaptertitle">Editha</h2>


<p>The air was thick with the war feeling, like the electricity of a
storm which has not yet burst. Editha sat looking out into the hot
spring afternoon, with her lips parted, and panting with the intensity
of the question whether she could let him go. She had decided that she
could not let him stay, when she saw him at the end of the still
leafless avenue, making slowly up towards the house, with his head down
and his figure relaxed. She ran impatiently out on the veranda, to the
edge of the steps, and imperatively demanded greater haste of him with
her will before she called aloud to him: &#8220;George!&#8221;</p>

<p>He had quickened his pace in mystical response to her mystical
urgence, before he could have heard her; now he looked up and answered,
&#8220;Well?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, how united we are!&#8221; she exulted, and then she
swooped down the steps to him. &#8220;What is it?&#8221; she cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s war,&#8221; he said, and he pulled her up to him
and kissed her.</p>

<p>She kissed him back intensely, but irrelevantly, as to their passion,
and uttered from deep in her throat. &#8220;How glorious!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s war,&#8221; he repeated, without consenting to her
sense of it; and she did not know just what to think at first. She never
knew what to think of him; that made his mystery, his charm. All through
their courtship, which was contemporaneous with the growth of the war
feeling, she had been puzzled by his want of seriousness about it. He
seemed to despise it even more than he abhorred it. She could have
understood his abhorring any sort of bloodshed; that would have been a
survival of his old life when he thought he would be a minister, and
before he changed and took up the law. But making light of a cause so
high and noble seemed to show a want of earnestness at the core of his
being. Not but that she felt herself able to cope with a congenital
defect of that sort, and make his love for her save him from himself.
Now perhaps the miracle was already wrought in him. In the presence of
the tremendous fact that he announced, all triviality seemed to have
gone out of him; she began to feel that. He sank down on the top step,
and wiped his forehead with his handkerchief, while she poured out upon
him her question of the origin and authenticity of his news.</p>

<p>All the while, in her duplex emotioning, she was aware that now at
the very beginning she must put a guard upon herself against urging him,
by any word or act, to take the part that her whole soul willed him to
take, for the completion of her ideal of him. He was very nearly perfect
as he was, and he must be allowed to perfect himself. But he was
peculiar, and he might very well be reasoned out of his peculiarity.
Before her reasoning went her emotioning: her nature pulling upon his
nature, her womanhood upon his manhood, without her knowing the means
she was using to the end she was willing. She had always supposed that
the man who won her would have done something to win her; she did not
know what, but something. George Gearson had simply asked her for her
love, on the way home from a concert, and she gave her love to him,
without, as it were, thinking. But now, it flashed upon her, if he could
do something worthy to <em>have</em> won her&#8212;be a hero,
<em>her</em> hero&#8212;it would be even better than if he had done it
before asking her; it would be grander. Besides, she had believed in the
war from the beginning.</p>

<p>&#8220;But don&#8217;t you see, dearest,&#8221; she said, &#8220;that
it wouldn&#8217;t have come to this if it hadn&#8217;t been in the order
of Providence? And I call any war glorious that is for the liberation of
people who have been struggling for years against the cruelest
oppression. Don&#8217;t you think so, too?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose so,&#8221; he returned, languidly. &#8220;But war!
Is it glorious to break the peace of the world?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That ignoble peace! It was no peace at all, with that crime
and shame at our very gates.&#8221; She was conscious of parroting the
current phrases of the newspapers, but it was no time to pick and choose
her words. She must sacrifice anything to the high ideal she had for
him, and after a good deal of rapid argument she ended with the climax:
&#8220;But now it doesn&#8217;t matter about the how or why. Since the
war has come, all that is gone. There are no two sides any more. There
is nothing now but our country.&#8221;</p>

<p>He sat with his eyes closed and his head leant back against the
veranda, and he remarked, with a vague smile, as if musing aloud,
&#8220;Our country&#8212;right or wrong.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, right or wrong!&#8221; she returned, fervidly.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll go and get you some lemonade.&#8221; She rose
rustling, and whisked away; when she came back with two tall glasses of
clouded liquid on a tray, and the ice clucking in them, he still sat as
she had left him, and she said, as if there had been no interruption:
&#8220;But there is no question of wrong in this case. I call it a
sacred war. A war for liberty and humanity, if ever there was one. And I
know you will see it just as I do, yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>He took half the lemonade at a gulp, and he answered as he set the
glass down: &#8220;I know you always have the highest ideal. When I
differ from you I ought to doubt myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>A generous sob rose in Editha&#8217;s throat for the humility of a
man, so very nearly perfect, who was willing to put himself below
her.</p>

<p>Besides, she felt, more subliminally, that he was never so near
slipping through her fingers as when he took that meek way.</p>

<p>&#8220;You shall not say that! Only, for once I happen to be
right.&#8221; She seized his hand in her two hands, and poured her soul
from her eyes into his. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you think so?&#8221; she
entreated him.</p>

<div class="illustration"><a href="images/illust5l.jpg" name="illust5"><img src="images/illust5m.jpg" title="&#8220;&#8216;YOU SHALL NOT SAY THAT!&#8217;&#8221;" alt="[Illustration: &#8220;&#8216;YOU SHALL NOT SAY THAT!&#8217;&#8221;]" style="width: 450px; height: 759px" /></a></div>

<p>He released his hand and drank the rest of his lemonade, and she
added, &#8220;Have mine, too,&#8221; but he shook his head in answering,
&#8220;I&#8217;ve no business to think so, unless I act so,
too.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her heart stopped a beat before it pulsed on with leaps that she felt
in her neck. She had noticed that strange thing in men: they seemed to
feel bound to do what they believed, and not think a thing was finished
when they said it, as girls did. She knew what was in his mind, but she
pretended not, and she said, &#8220;Oh, I am not sure,&#8221; and then
faltered.</p>

<p>He went on as if to himself, without apparently heeding her:
&#8220;There&#8217;s only one way of proving one&#8217;s faith in a
thing like this.&#8221;</p>

<p>She could not say that she understood, but she did understand.</p>

<p>He went on again. &#8220;If I believed&#8212;if I felt as you do
about this war&#8212;Do you wish me to feel as you do?&#8221;</p>

<p>Now she was really not sure; so she said: &#8220;George, I
don&#8217;t know what you mean.&#8221;</p>

<p>He seemed to muse away from her as before.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is a sort of fascination in it. I suppose that at the
bottom of his heart every man would like at times to have his courage
tested, to see how he would act.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How can you talk in that ghastly way?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It <em>is</em> rather morbid. Still, that&#8217;s what it
comes to, unless you&#8217;re swept away by ambition or driven by
conviction. I haven&#8217;t the conviction or the ambition, and the
other thing is what it comes to with me. I ought to have been a
preacher, after all; then I couldn&#8217;t have asked it of myself, as I
must, now I&#8217;m a lawyer. And you believe it&#8217;s a holy war,
Editha?&#8221; he suddenly addressed her. &#8220;Oh, I know you do! But
you wish me to believe so, too?&#8221;</p>

<p>She hardly knew whether he was mocking or not, in the ironical way he
always had with her plainer mind. But the only thing was to be outspoken
with him.</p>

<p>&#8220;George, I wish you to believe whatever you think is true, at
any and every cost. If I&#8217;ve tried to talk you into anything, I
take it all back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I know that, Editha. I know how sincere you are, and
how&#8212;I wish I had your undoubting spirit! I&#8217;ll think it over;
I&#8217;d like to believe as you do. But I don&#8217;t, now; I
don&#8217;t, indeed. It isn&#8217;t this war alone; though this seems
peculiarly wanton and needless; but it&#8217;s every war&#8212;so
stupid; it makes me sick. Why shouldn&#8217;t this thing have been
settled reasonably?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because,&#8221; she said, very throatily again, &#8220;God
meant it to be war.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You think it was God? Yes, I suppose that is what people will
say.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you suppose it would have been war if God hadn&#8217;t
meant it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. Sometimes it seems as if God had put this
world into men&#8217;s keeping to work it as they pleased.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, George, that is blasphemy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I won&#8217;t blaspheme. I&#8217;ll try to believe in
your pocket Providence,&#8221; he said, and then he rose to go.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you stay to dinner?&#8221; Dinner at
Balcom&#8217;s Works was at one o&#8217;clock.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll come back to supper, if you&#8217;ll let me.
Perhaps I shall bring you a convert.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you may come back, on that condition.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right. If I don&#8217;t come, you&#8217;ll
understand.&#8221;</p>

<p>He went away without kissing her, and she felt it a suspension of
their engagement. It all interested her intensely; she was undergoing a
tremendous experience, and she was being equal to it. While she stood
looking after him, her mother came out through one of the long windows
onto the veranda, with a catlike softness and vagueness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t he stay to dinner?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because&#8212;because&#8212;war has been declared,&#8221;
Editha pronounced, without turning.</p>

<p>Her mother said, &#8220;Oh, my!&#8221; and then said nothing more
until she had sat down in one of the large Shaker chairs and rocked
herself for some time. Then she closed whatever tacit passage of thought
there had been in her mind with the spoken words: &#8220;Well, I hope
<em>he</em> won&#8217;t go.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And <em>I</em> hope he <em>will</em>,&#8221; the girl said,
and confronted her mother with a stormy exaltation that would have
frightened any creature less unimpressionable than a cat.</p>

<p>Her mother rocked herself again for an interval of cogitation. What
she arrived at in speech was: &#8220;Well, I guess you&#8217;ve done a
wicked thing, Editha Balcom.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl said, as she passed indoors through the same window her
mother had come out by: &#8220;I haven&#8217;t done
anything&#8212;yet.&#8221;</p>

<hr />

<p>In her room, she put together all her letters and gifts from Gearson,
down to the withered petals of the first flower he had offered, with
that timidity of his veiled in that irony of his. In the heart of the
packet she enshrined her engagement ring which she had restored to the
pretty box he had brought it her in. Then she sat down, if not calmly
yet strongly, and wrote:</p>

<div class="letter">
<p> &#8220;GEORGE:&#8212;I understood when you left me. But I think we
    had better emphasize your meaning that if we cannot be one in
    everything we had better be one in nothing. So I am sending these
    things for your keeping till you have made up your mind.</p>

<p> &#8220;I shall always love you, and therefore I shall never marry
    any one else. But the man I marry must love his country first of
    all, and be able to say to me,</p>

<p class="poetry">&#8220;&#8216;I could not love thee, dear, so much,
    <br />Loved I not honor more.&#8217;</p>

<p> &#8220;There is no honor above America with me. In this great hour
    there is no other honor.</p>

<p> &#8220;Your heart will make my words clear to you. I had never
    expected to say so much, but it has come upon me that I must say the
    utmost.</p>

<p> EDITHA.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>She thought she had worded her letter well, worded it in a way that
could not be bettered; all had been implied and nothing expressed.</p>

<p>She had it ready to send with the packet she had tied with red,
white, and blue ribbon, when it occurred to her that she was not just to
him, that she was not giving him a fair chance. He had said he would go
and think it over, and she was not waiting. She was pushing,
threatening, compelling. That was not a woman&#8217;s part. She must
leave him free, free, free. She could not accept for her country or
herself a forced sacrifice.</p>

<p>In writing her letter she had satisfied the impulse from which it
sprang; she could well afford to wait till he had thought it over. She
put the packet and the letter by, and rested serene in the consciousness
of having done what was laid upon her by her love itself to do, and yet
used patience, mercy, justice.</p>

<p>She had her reward. Gearson did not come to tea, but she had given
him till morning, when, late at night there came up from the village the
sound of a fife and drum, with a tumult of voices, in shouting, singing,
and laughing. The noise drew nearer and nearer; it reached the street
end of the avenue; there it silenced itself, and one voice, the voice
she knew best, rose over the silence. It fell; the air was filled with
cheers; the fife and drum struck up, with the shouting, singing, and
laughing again, but now retreating; and a single figure came hurrying up
the avenue.</p>

<p>She ran down to meet her lover and clung to him. He was very gay, and
he put his arm round her with a boisterous laugh. &#8220;Well, you must
call me Captain now; or Cap, if you prefer; that&#8217;s what the boys
call me. Yes, we&#8217;ve had a meeting at the town-hall, and everybody
has volunteered; and they selected me for captain, and I&#8217;m going
to the war, the big war, the glorious war, the holy war ordained by the
pocket Providence that blesses butchery. Come along; let&#8217;s tell
the whole family about it. Call them from their downy beds, father,
mother, Aunt Hitty, and all the folks!&#8221;</p>

<p>But when they mounted the veranda steps he did not wait for a larger
audience; he poured the story out upon Editha alone.</p>

<p>&#8220;There was a lot of speaking, and then some of the fools set up
a shout for me. It was all going one way, and I thought it would be a
good joke to sprinkle a little cold water on them. But you can&#8217;t
do that with a crowd that adores you. The first thing I knew I was
sprinkling hell-fire on them. &#8216;Cry havoc, and let slip the dogs of
war.&#8217; That was the style. Now that it had come to the fight, there
were no two parties; there was one country, and the thing was to fight
to a finish as quick as possible. I suggested volunteering then and
there, and I wrote my name first of all on the roster. Then they elected
me&#8212;that&#8217;s all. I wish I had some ice-water.&#8221;</p>

<p>She left him walking up and down the veranda, while she ran for the
ice-pitcher and a goblet, and when she came back he was still walking up
and down, shouting the story he had told her to her father and mother,
who had come out more sketchily dressed than they commonly were by day.
He drank goblet after goblet of the ice-water without noticing who was
giving it, and kept on talking, and laughing through his talk wildly.
&#8220;It&#8217;s astonishing,&#8221; he said, &#8220;how well the worse
reason looks when you try to make it appear the better. Why, I believe I
was the first convert to the war in that crowd to-night! I never thought
I should like to kill a man; but now I shouldn&#8217;t care; and the
smokeless powder lets you see the man drop that you kill. It&#8217;s all
for the country! What a thing it is to have a country that
<em>can&#8217;t</em> be wrong, but if it is, is right,
anyway!&#8221;</p>

<p>Editha had a great, vital thought, an inspiration. She set down the
ice-pitcher on the veranda floor, and ran up-stairs and got the letter
she had written him. When at last he noisily bade her father and mother,
&#8220;Well, good-night. I forgot I woke you up; I sha&#8217;n&#8217;t
want any sleep myself,&#8221; she followed him down the avenue to the
gate. There, after the whirling words that seemed to fly away from her
thoughts and refuse to serve them, she made a last effort to solemnize
the moment that seemed so crazy, and pressed the letter she had written
upon him.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s this?&#8221; he said. &#8220;Want me to mail
it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no. It&#8217;s for you. I wrote it after you went this
morning. Keep it&#8212;keep it&#8212;and read it sometime&#8212;&#8221;
She thought, and then her inspiration came: &#8220;Read it if ever you
doubt what you&#8217;ve done, or fear that I regret your having done it.
Read it after you&#8217;ve started.&#8221;</p>

<p>They strained each other in embraces that seemed as ineffective as
their words, and he kissed her face with quick, hot breaths that were so
unlike him, that made her feel as if she had lost her old lover and
found a stranger in his place. The stranger said: &#8220;What a gorgeous
flower you are, with your red hair, and your blue eyes that look black
now, and your face with the color painted out by the white moonshine!
Let me hold you under the chin, to see whether I love blood, you
tiger-lily!&#8221; Then he laughed Gearson&#8217;s laugh, and released
her, scared and giddy. Within her wilfulness she had been frightened by
a sense of subtler force in him, and mystically mastered as she had
never been before.</p>

<p>She ran all the way back to the house, and mounted the steps panting.
Her mother and father were talking of the great affair. Her mother said:
&#8220;Wa&#8217;n&#8217;t Mr. Gearson in rather of an excited state of
mind? Didn&#8217;t you think he acted curious?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, not for a man who&#8217;d just been elected captain and
had set &#8217;em up for the whole of Company A,&#8221; her father
chuckled back.</p>

<p>&#8220;What in the world do you mean, Mr. Balcom? Oh! There&#8217;s
Editha!&#8221; She offered to follow the girl indoors.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t come, mother!&#8221; Editha called, vanishing.</p>

<p>Mrs. Balcom remained to reproach her husband. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
see much of anything to laugh at.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s catching. Caught it from Gearson. I guess it
won&#8217;t be much of a war, and I guess Gearson don&#8217;t think so,
either. The other fellows will back down as soon as they see we mean it.
I wouldn&#8217;t lose any sleep over it. I&#8217;m going back to bed,
myself.&#8221;</p>

<hr />

<p>Gearson came again next afternoon, looking pale and rather sick, but
quite himself, even to his languid irony. &#8220;I guess I&#8217;d
better tell you, Editha, that I consecrated myself to your god of
battles last night by pouring too many libations to him down my own
throat. But I&#8217;m all right now. One has to carry off the
excitement, somehow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Promise me,&#8221; she commanded, &#8220;that you&#8217;ll
never touch it again!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What! Not let the cannikin clink? Not let the soldier drink?
Well, I promise.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t belong to yourself now; you don&#8217;t even
belong to <em>me</em>. You belong to your country, and you have a sacred
charge to keep yourself strong and well for your country&#8217;s sake. I
have been thinking, thinking all night and all day long.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You look as if you had been crying a little, too,&#8221; he
said, with his queer smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all past. I&#8217;ve been thinking, and
worshipping <em>you</em>. Don&#8217;t you suppose I know all that
you&#8217;ve been through, to come to this? I&#8217;ve followed you
every step from your old theories and opinions.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you&#8217;ve had a long row to hoe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I know you&#8217;ve done this from the highest
motives&#8212;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, there won&#8217;t be much pettifogging to do till this
cruel war is&#8212;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you haven&#8217;t simply done it for my sake. I
couldn&#8217;t respect you if you had.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then we&#8217;ll say I haven&#8217;t. A man that
hasn&#8217;t got his own respect intact wants the respect of all the
other people he can corner. But we won&#8217;t go into that. I&#8217;m
in for the thing now, and we&#8217;ve got to face our future. My idea is
that this isn&#8217;t going to be a very protracted struggle; we shall
just scare the enemy to death before it comes to a fight at all. But we
must provide for contingencies, Editha. If anything happens to
me&#8212;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, George!&#8221; She clung to him, sobbing.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want you to feel foolishly bound to my memory. I
should hate that, wherever I happened to be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am yours, for time and eternity&#8212;time and
eternity.&#8221; She liked the words; they satisfied her famine for
phrases.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, say eternity; that&#8217;s all right; but time&#8217;s
another thing; and I&#8217;m talking about time. But there is something!
My mother! If anything happens&#8212;&#8221;</p>

<p>She winced, and he laughed. &#8220;You&#8217;re not the bold
soldier-girl of yesterday!&#8221; Then he sobered. &#8220;If anything
happens, I want you to help my mother out. She won&#8217;t like my doing
this thing. She brought me up to think war a fool thing as well as a bad
thing. My father was in the Civil War; all through it; lost his arm in
it.&#8221; She thrilled with the sense of the arm round her; what if
that should be lost? He laughed as if divining her: &#8220;Oh, it
doesn&#8217;t run in the family, as far as I know!&#8221; Then he added,
gravely: &#8220;He came home with misgivings about war, and they grew on
him. I guess he and mother agreed between them that I was to be brought
up in his final mind about it; but that was before my time. I only knew
him from my mother&#8217;s report of him and his opinions; I don&#8217;t
know whether they were hers first; but they were hers last. This will be
a blow to her. I shall have to write and tell her&#8212;&#8221;</p>

<p>He stopped, and she asked: &#8220;Would you like me to write, too,
George?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe that would do. No, I&#8217;ll do the
writing. She&#8217;ll understand a little if I say that I thought the
way to minimize it was to make war on the largest possible scale at
once&#8212;that I felt I must have been helping on the war somehow if I
hadn&#8217;t helped keep it from coming, and I knew I hadn&#8217;t; when
it came, I had no right to stay out of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Whether his sophistries satisfied him or not, they satisfied her. She
clung to his breast, and whispered, with closed eyes and quivering lips:
&#8220;Yes, yes, yes!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But if anything should happen, you might go to her and see
what you could do for her. You know? It&#8217;s rather far off; she
can&#8217;t leave her chair&#8212;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ll go, if it&#8217;s the ends of the earth! But
nothing will happen! Nothing <em>can!</em> I&#8212;&#8221;</p>

<p>She felt herself lifted with his rising, and Gearson was saying, with
his arm still round her, to her father: &#8220;Well, we&#8217;re off at
once, Mr. Balcom. We&#8217;re to be formally accepted at the capital,
and then bunched up with the rest somehow, and sent into camp somewhere,
and got to the front as soon as possible. We all want to be in the van,
of course; we&#8217;re the first company to report to the Governor. I
came to tell Editha, but I hadn&#8217;t got round to it.&#8221;</p>

<hr />

<p>She saw him again for a moment at the capital, in the station, just
before the train started southward with his regiment. He looked well, in
his uniform, and very soldierly, but somehow girlish, too, with his
clean-shaven face and slim figure. The manly eyes and the strong voice
satisfied her, and his preoccupation with some unexpected details of
duty flattered her. Other girls were weeping and bemoaning themselves,
but she felt a sort of noble distinction in the abstraction, the almost
unconsciousness, with which they parted. Only at the last moment he
said: &#8220;Don&#8217;t forget my mother. It mayn&#8217;t be such a
walk-over as I supposed,&#8221; and he laughed at the notion.</p>

<p>He waved his hand to her as the train moved off&#8212;she knew it
among a score of hands that were waved to other girls from the platform
of the car, for it held a letter which she knew was hers. Then he went
inside the car to read it, doubtless, and she did not see him again. But
she felt safe for him through the strength of what she called her love.
What she called her God, always speaking the name in a deep voice and
with the implication of a mutual understanding, would watch over him and
keep him and bring him back to her. If with an empty sleeve, then he
should have three arms instead of two, for both of hers should be his
for life. She did not see, though, why she should always be thinking of
the arm his father had lost.</p>

<p>There were not many letters from him, but they were such as she could
have wished, and she put her whole strength into making hers such as she
imagined he could have wished, glorifying and supporting him. She wrote
to his mother glorifying him as their hero, but the brief answer she got
was merely to the effect that Mrs. Gearson was not well enough to write
herself, and thanking her for her letter by the hand of some one who
called herself &#8220;Yrs truly, Mrs. W.J. Andrews.&#8221;</p>

<p>Editha determined not to be hurt, but to write again quite as if the
answer had been all she expected. Before it seemed as if she could have
written, there came news of the first skirmish, and in the list of the
killed, which was telegraphed as a trifling loss on our side, was
Gearson&#8217;s name. There was a frantic time of trying to make out
that it might be, must be, some other Gearson; but the name and the
company and the regiment and the State were too definitely given.</p>

<p>Then there was a lapse into depths out of which it seemed as if she
never could rise again; then a lift into clouds far above all grief,
black clouds, that blotted out the sun, but where she soared with him,
with George&#8212;George! She had the fever that she expected of
herself, but she did not die in it; she was not even delirious, and it
did not last long. When she was well enough to leave her bed, her one
thought was of George&#8217;s mother, of his strangely worded wish that
she should go to her and see what she could do for her. In the
exaltation of the duty laid upon her&#8212;it buoyed her up instead of
burdening her&#8212;she rapidly recovered.</p>

<p>Her father went with her on the long railroad journey from northern
New York to western Iowa; he had business out at Davenport, and he said
he could just as well go then as any other time; and he went with her to
the little country town where George&#8217;s mother lived in a little
house on the edge of the illimitable cornfields, under trees pushed to a
top of the rolling prairie. George&#8217;s father had settled there
after the Civil War, as so many other old soldiers had done; but they
were Eastern people, and Editha fancied touches of the East in the June
rose overhanging the front door, and the garden with early summer
flowers stretching from the gate of the paling fence.</p>

<p>It was very low inside the house, and so dim, with the closed blinds,
that they could scarcely see one another: Editha tall and black in her
crapes which filled the air with the smell of their dyes; her father
standing decorously apart with his hat on his forearm, as at funerals; a
woman rested in a deep arm-chair, and the woman who had let the
strangers in stood behind the chair.</p>

<p>The seated woman turned her head round and up, and asked the woman
behind her chair: &#8220;<em>Who</em> did you say?&#8221;</p>

<p>Editha, if she had done what she expected of herself, would have gone
down on her knees at the feet of the seated figure and said, &#8220;I am
George&#8217;s Editha,&#8221; for answer.</p>

<p>But instead of her own voice she heard that other woman&#8217;s
voice, saying: &#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t know as I <em>did</em> get the
name just right. I guess I&#8217;ll have to make a little more light in
here,&#8221; and she went and pushed two of the shutters ajar.</p>

<p>Then Editha&#8217;s father said, in his public
will-now-address-a-few-remarks tone: &#8220;My name is Balcom,
ma&#8217;am&#8212;Junius H. Balcom, of Balcom&#8217;s Works, New York;
my daughter&#8212;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; the seated woman broke in, with a powerful voice,
the voice that always surprised Editha from Gearson&#8217;s slender
frame. &#8220;Let me see you. Stand round where the light can strike on
your face,&#8221; and Editha dumbly obeyed. &#8220;So, you&#8217;re
Editha Balcom,&#8221; she sighed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Editha said, more like a culprit than a
comforter.</p>

<p>&#8220;What did you come for?&#8221; Mrs. Gearson asked.</p>

<p>Editha&#8217;s face quivered and her knees shook. &#8220;I
came&#8212;because&#8212;because George&#8212;&#8221; She could go no
further.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; the mother said, &#8220;he told me he had asked
you to come if he got killed. You didn&#8217;t expect that, I suppose,
when you sent him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I would rather have died myself than done it!&#8221; Editha
said, with more truth in her deep voice than she ordinarily found in it.
&#8220;I tried to leave him free&#8212;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, that letter of yours, that came back with his other
things, left him free.&#8221;</p>

<p>Editha saw now where George&#8217;s irony came from.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was not to be read before&#8212;unless&#8212;until&#8212;I
told him so,&#8221; she faltered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, he wouldn&#8217;t read a letter of yours, under the
circumstances, till he thought you wanted him to. Been sick?&#8221; the
woman abruptly demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very sick,&#8221; Editha said, with self-pity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Daughter&#8217;s life,&#8221; her father interposed,
&#8220;was almost despaired of, at one time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Gearson gave him no heed. &#8220;I suppose you would have been
glad to die, such a brave person as you! I don&#8217;t believe
<em>he</em> was glad to die. He was always a timid boy, that way; he was
afraid of a good many things; but if he was afraid he did what he made
up his mind to. I suppose he made up his mind to go, but I knew what it
cost him by what it cost me when I heard of it. I had been through
<em>one</em> war before. When you sent him you didn&#8217;t expect he
would get killed.&#8221;</p>

<p>The voice seemed to compassionate Editha, and it was time.
&#8220;No,&#8221; she huskily murmured.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, girls don&#8217;t; women don&#8217;t, when they give their
men up to their country. They think they&#8217;ll come marching back,
somehow, just as gay as they went, or if it&#8217;s an empty sleeve, or
even an empty pantaloon, it&#8217;s all the more glory, and
they&#8217;re so much the prouder of them, poor things!&#8221;</p>

<p>The tears began to run down Editha&#8217;s face; she had not wept
till then; but it was now such a relief to be understood that the tears
came.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, you didn&#8217;t expect him to get killed,&#8221; Mrs.
Gearson repeated, in a voice which was startlingly like George&#8217;s
again. &#8220;You just expected him to kill some one else, some of those
foreigners, that weren&#8217;t there because they had any say about it,
but because they had to be there, poor wretches&#8212;conscripts, or
whatever they call &#8217;em. You thought it would be all right for my
George, <em>your</em> George, to kill the sons of those miserable
mothers and the husbands of those girls that you would never see the
faces of.&#8221; The woman lifted her powerful voice in a psalmlike
note. &#8220;I thank my God he didn&#8217;t live to do it! I thank my
God they killed him first, and that he ain&#8217;t livin&#8217; with
their blood on his hands!&#8221; She dropped her eyes, which she had
raised with her voice, and glared at Editha. &#8220;What you got that
black on for?&#8221; She lifted herself by her powerful arms so high
that her helpless body seemed to hang limp its full length. &#8220;Take
it off, take it off, before I tear it from your back!&#8221;</p>

<div class="illustration"><a href="images/illust6l.jpg" name="illust6"><img src="images/illust6m.jpg" title="&#8220;SHE GLARED AT EDITHA. &#8216;WHAT YOU GOT THAT BLACK ON FOR?&#8217;&#8221;" alt="[Illustration: &#8220;SHE GLARED AT EDITHA. &#8216;WHAT YOU GOT THAT BLACK ON FOR?&#8217;&#8221;]" style="width: 450px; height: 773px" /></a></div>

<hr />

<p>The lady who was passing the summer near Balcom&#8217;s Works was
sketching Editha&#8217;s beauty, which lent itself wonderfully to the
effects of a colorist. It had come to that confidence which is rather
apt to grow between artist and sitter, and Editha had told her
everything.</p>

<p>&#8220;To think of your having such a tragedy in your life!&#8221;
the lady said. She added: &#8220;I suppose there are people who feel
that way about war. But when you consider the good this war has
done&#8212;how much it has done for the country! I can&#8217;t
understand such people, for my part. And when you had come all the way
out there to console her&#8212;got up out of a sick-bed!
Well!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; Editha said, magnanimously, &#8220;she
wasn&#8217;t quite in her right mind; and so did papa.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; the lady said, looking at Editha&#8217;s lips in
nature and then at her lips in art, and giving an empirical touch to
them in the picture. &#8220;But how dreadful of her! How
perfectly&#8212;excuse me&#8212;how <em>vulgar!</em>&#8221;</p>

<p>A light broke upon Editha in the darkness which she felt had been
without a gleam of brightness for weeks and months. The mystery that had
bewildered her was solved by the word; and from that moment she rose
from grovelling in shame and self-pity, and began to live again in the
ideal.</p>

<h2 class="chaptertitle">Braybridge&#8217;s Offer</h2>


<p>We had ordered our dinners and were sitting in the Turkish room at
the club, waiting to be called, each in his turn, to the dining-room. It
was always a cosey place, whether you found yourself in it with cigars
and coffee after dinner, or with whatever liquid or solid appetizer you
preferred in the half-hour or more that must pass before dinner after
you had made out your menu. It intimated an exclusive possession in the
three or four who happened first to find themselves together in it, and
it invited the philosophic mind to contemplation more than any other
spot in the club.</p>

<p>Our rather limited little down-town dining-club was almost a celibate
community at most times. A few husbands and fathers joined us at lunch;
but at dinner we were nearly always a company of bachelors, dropping in
an hour or so before we wished to dine, and ordering from a bill of fare
what we liked. Some dozed away in the intervening time; some read the
evening papers or played chess; I preferred the chance society of the
Turkish room. I could be pretty sure of finding Wanhope there in these
sympathetic moments, and where Wanhope was there would probably be
Rulledge, passively willing to listen and agree, and Minver ready to
interrupt and dispute. I myself liked to look in and linger for either
the reasoning or the bickering, as it happened, and now, seeing the
three there together, I took a provisional seat behind the painter, who
made no sign of knowing I was present. Rulledge was eating a caviar
sandwich, which he had brought from the afternoon tea-table near by, and
he greedily incited Wanhope to go on, in the polite pause which the
psychologist had let follow on my appearance, with what he was saying. I
was not surprised to find that his talk related to a fact just then
intensely interesting to the few, rapidly becoming the many, who were
privy to it; though Wanhope had the air of stooping to it from a higher
range of thinking.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t have supposed, somehow,&#8221; he said, with
a knot of deprecation between his fine eyes, &#8220;that he would have
had the pluck.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps he hadn&#8217;t,&#8221; Minver suggested.</p>

<p>Wanhope waited for a thoughtful moment of censure eventuating in
toleration. &#8220;You mean that she&#8212;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see why you say that, Minver,&#8221; Rulledge
interposed, chivalrously, with his mouth full of sandwich.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t say it,&#8221; Minver contradicted.</p>

<p>&#8220;You implied it; and I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s fair.
It&#8217;s easy enough to build up a report of that kind on the
half-knowledge of rumor which is all that any outsider can have in the
case.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So far,&#8221; Minver said, with unbroken tranquillity,
&#8220;as any such edifice has been erected, you are the architect,
Rulledge. I shouldn&#8217;t think you would like to go round insinuating
that sort of thing. Here is Acton,&#8221; and he now acknowledged my
presence with a backward twist of his head, &#8220;on the alert for
material already. You ought to be more careful where Acton is,
Rulledge.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It would be great copy if it were true,&#8221; I owned.</p>

<p>Wanhope regarded us all three, in this play of our qualities, with
the scientific impartiality of a bacteriologist in the study of a
culture offering some peculiar incidents. He took up a point as remote
as might be from the personal appeal. &#8220;It is curious how little we
know of such matters, after all the love-making and marrying in life and
all the inquiry of the poets and novelists.&#8221; He addressed himself
in this turn of his thought, half playful, half earnest, to me, as if I
united with the functions of both a responsibility for their
shortcomings.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Minver said, facing about towards me. &#8220;How
do you excuse yourself for your ignorance in matters where you&#8217;re
always professionally making such a bluff of knowledge? After all the
marriages you have brought about in literature, can you say positively
and specifically how they are brought about in life?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I can&#8217;t,&#8221; I admitted. &#8220;I might say that
a writer of fiction is a good deal like a minister who continually
marries people without knowing why.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, you couldn&#8217;t, my dear fellow,&#8221; the painter
retorted. &#8220;It&#8217;s part of your swindle to assume that you
<em>do</em> know why. You ought to find out.&#8221;</p>

<p>Wanhope interposed concretely, or as concretely as he could:
&#8220;The important thing would always be to find which of the lovers
the confession, tacit or explicit, began with.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Acton ought to go round and collect human documents bearing on
the question. He ought to have got together thousands of specimens from
nature. He ought to have gone to all the married couples he knew, and
asked them just how their passion was confessed; he ought to have sent
out printed circulars, with tabulated questions. Why don&#8217;t you do
it, Acton?&#8221;</p>

<p>I returned, as seriously as could have been expected:</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps it would be thought rather intimate. People
don&#8217;t like to talk of such things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re ashamed,&#8221; Minver declared. &#8220;The
lovers don&#8217;t either of them, in a given case, like to let others
know how much the woman had to do with making the offer, and how little
the man.&#8221;</p>

<p>Minver&#8217;s point provoked both Wanhope and myself to begin a
remark at the same time. We begged each other&#8217;s pardon, and
Wanhope insisted that I should go on.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, merely this,&#8221; I said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think
they&#8217;re so much ashamed as that they have forgotten the different
stages. You were going to say&#8212;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very much what you said. It&#8217;s astonishing how people
forget the vital things and remember trifles. Or perhaps as we advance
from stage to stage what once seemed the vital things turn to trifles.
Nothing can be more vital in the history of a man and a woman than how
they became husband and wife, and yet not merely the details, but the
main fact, would seem to escape record if not recollection. The next
generations knows nothing of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That appears to let Acton out,&#8221; Minver said. &#8220;But
how do <em>you</em> know what you were saying, Wanhope?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve ventured to make some inquiries in that region at
one time. Not directly, of course. At second and third hand. It
isn&#8217;t inconceivable, if we conceive of a life after this, that a
man should forget, in its more important interests and occupations, just
how he quitted this world, or at least the particulars of the article of
death. Of course, we must suppose a good portion of eternity to have
elapsed.&#8221; Wanhope continued, dreamily, with a deep breath almost
equivalent to something so unscientific as a sigh: &#8220;Women are
charming, and in nothing more than the perpetual challenge they form for
us. They are born defying us to match ourselves with them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean that Miss Hazelwood&#8212;&#8221; Rulledge began,
but Minver&#8217;s laugh arrested him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing so concrete, I&#8217;m afraid,&#8221; Wanhope gently
returned. &#8220;I mean, to match them in graciousness, in loveliness,
in all the agile contests of spirit and plays of fancy. It&#8217;s
pathetic to see them caught up into something more serious in that other
game, which they are so good at.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They seem rather to like it, though, some of them, if you mean
the game of love,&#8221; Minver said. &#8220;Especially when
they&#8217;re not in earnest about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, there are plenty of spoiled women,&#8221; Wanhope
admitted. &#8220;But I don&#8217;t mean flirting. I suppose that the
average unspoiled woman is rather frightened than otherwise when she
knows that a man is in love with her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you suppose she always knows it first?&#8221; Rulledge
asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;You may be sure,&#8221; Minver answered for Wanhope,
&#8220;that if she didn&#8217;t know it, <em>he</em> never would.&#8221;
Then Wanhope answered for himself:</p>

<p>&#8220;I think that generally she sees it coming. In that sort of
wireless telegraphy, that reaching out of two natures through space
towards each other, her more sensitive apparatus probably feels the
appeal of his before he is conscious of having made any
appeal.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And her first impulse is to escape the appeal?&#8221; I
suggested.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Wanhope admitted, after a thoughtful
reluctance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Even when she is half aware of having invited it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If she is not spoiled she is never aware of having invited it.
Take the case in point; we won&#8217;t mention any names. She is sailing
through time, through youthful space, with her electrical lures, the
natural equipment of every charming woman, all out, and suddenly,
somewhere from the unknown, she feels the shock of a response in the
gulfs of air where there had been no life before. But she can&#8217;t be
said to have knowingly searched the void for any presence.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m not sure about that, Professor,&#8221; Minver
put in. &#8220;Go a little slower, if you expect me to follow
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all a mystery, the most beautiful mystery of
life,&#8221; Wanhope resumed. &#8220;I don&#8217;t believe I could make
out the case as I feel it to be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Braybridge&#8217;s part of the case is rather plain,
isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; I invited him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not sure of that. No man&#8217;s part of any case is
plain, if you look at it carefully. The most that you can say of
Braybridge is that he is rather a simple nature. But nothing,&#8221; the
psychologist added, with one of his deep breaths, &#8220;is so complex
as a simple nature.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; Minver contended, &#8220;Braybridge is plain, if
his case isn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Plain? Is he plain?&#8221; Wanhope asked, as if asking
himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear fellow, you agnostics doubt everything!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should have said picturesque. Picturesque, with the sort of
unbeautifulness that takes the fancy of women more than Greek
proportion. I think it would require a girl peculiarly feminine to feel
the attraction of such a man&#8212;the fascination of his being grizzled
and slovenly and rugged. She would have to be rather a wild, shy girl to
do that, and it would have to be through her fear of him that she would
divine his fear of her. But what I have heard is that they met under
rather exceptional circumstances. It was at a house in the Adirondacks,
where Braybridge was, somewhat in the quality of a bull in a china-shop.
He was lugged in by the host, as an old friend, and was suffered by the
hostess as a friend quite too old for her. At any rate, as I heard (and
I don&#8217;t vouch for the facts, all of them), Braybridge found
himself at odds with the gay young people who made up the
hostess&#8217;s end of the party, and was watching for a chance
to&#8212;&#8221;</p>

<p>Wanhope cast about for the word, and Minver supplied
it&#8212;&#8220;Pull out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. But when he had found it Miss Hazelwood took it from
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand,&#8221; Rulledge said.</p>

<p>&#8220;When he came in to breakfast, the third morning, prepared with
an excuse for cutting his week down to the dimensions it had reached, he
saw her sitting alone at the table. She had risen early as a consequence
of having arrived late the night before; and when Braybridge found
himself in for it, he forgot that he meant to go away, and said
good-morning, as if they knew each other. Their hostess found them
talking over the length of the table in a sort of mutual fright, and
introduced them. But it&#8217;s rather difficult reporting a lady
verbatim at second hand. I really had the facts from Welkin, who had
them from his wife. The sum of her impressions was that Braybridge and
Miss Hazelwood were getting a kind of comfort out of their mutual terror
because one was as badly frightened as the other. It was a novel
experience for both. Ever seen her?&#8221;</p>

<p>We looked at one another. Minver said: &#8220;I never wanted to paint
any one so much. It was at the spring show of the American Artists.
There was a jam of people; but this girl&#8212;I&#8217;ve understood it
was she&#8212;looked as much alone as if there were nobody else there.
She might have been a startled doe in the North Woods suddenly coming
out on a twenty-thousand-dollar camp, with a lot of
twenty-million-dollar people on the veranda.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you wanted to do her as The Startled Doe,&#8221; I said.
&#8220;Good selling name.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t reduce it to the vulgarity of fiction. I admit it
would be a selling name.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go on, Wanhope,&#8221; Rulledge puffed impatiently.
&#8220;Though I don&#8217;t see how there could be another soul in the
universe as constitutionally scared of men as Braybridge is of
women.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In the universe nothing is wasted, I suppose. Everything has
its complement, its response. For every bashful man, there must be a
bashful woman,&#8221; Wanhope returned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Or a bold one,&#8221; Minver suggested.</p>

<p>&#8220;No; the response must be in kind to be truly complemental.
Through the sense of their reciprocal timidity they divine that they
needn&#8217;t be afraid.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! <em>That&#8217;s</em> the way you get out of
it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; Rulledge urged.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid,&#8221; Wanhope modestly confessed,
&#8220;that from this point I shall have to be largely conjectural.
Welkin wasn&#8217;t able to be very definite, except as to moments, and
he had his data almost altogether from his wife. Braybridge had told him
overnight that he thought of going, and he had said he mustn&#8217;t
think of it; but he supposed Braybridge had spoken of it to Mrs. Welkin,
and he began by saying to his wife that he hoped she had refused to hear
of Braybridge&#8217;s going. She said she hadn&#8217;t heard of it, but
now she would refuse without hearing, and she didn&#8217;t give
Braybridge any chance to protest. If people went in the middle of their
week, what would become of other people? She was not going to have the
equilibrium of her party disturbed, and that was all about it. Welkin
thought it was odd that Braybridge didn&#8217;t insist; and he made a
long story of it. But the grain of wheat in his bushel of chaff was that
Miss Hazelwood seemed to be fascinated by Braybridge from the first.
When Mrs. Welkin scared him into saying that he would stay his week out,
the business practically was done. They went picnicking that day in each
other&#8217;s charge; and after Braybridge left he wrote back to her, as
Mrs. Welkin knew from the letters that passed through her hands,
and&#8212;Well, their engagement has come out, and&#8212;&#8221; Wanhope
paused, with an air that was at first indefinite, and then
definitive.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t mean,&#8221; Rulledge burst out in a note of
deep wrong, &#8220;that that&#8217;s all you know about it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s all I know,&#8221; Wanhope confessed, as if
somewhat surprised himself at the fact.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well!&#8221;</p>

<p>Wanhope tried to offer the only reparation in his power. &#8220;I can
conjecture&#8212;we can all conjecture&#8212;&#8221;</p>

<p>He hesitated; then: &#8220;Well, go on with your conjecture,&#8221;
Rulledge said, forgivingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why&#8212;&#8221; Wanhope began again; but at that moment a
man who had been elected the year before, and then gone off on a long
absence, put his head in between the dull-red hangings of the doorway.
It was Halson, whom I did not know very well, but liked better than I
knew. His eyes were dancing with what seemed the inextinguishable gayety
of his temperament, rather than any present occasion, and his smile
carried his little mustache well away from his handsome teeth.
&#8220;Private?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come in! come in!&#8221; Minver called to him. &#8220;Thought
you were in Japan?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear fellow,&#8221; Halson answered, &#8220;you must brush
up your contemporary history. It&#8217;s more than a fortnight since I
was in Japan.&#8221; He shook hands with me, and I introduced him to
Rulledge and Wanhope. He said at once: &#8220;Well, what is it? Question
of Braybridge&#8217;s engagement? It&#8217;s humiliating to a man to
come back from the antipodes and find the nation absorbed in a parochial
problem like that. Everybody I&#8217;ve met here to-night has asked me,
the first thing, if I&#8217;d heard of it, and if I knew how it could
have happened.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And do you?&#8221; Rulledge asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can give a pretty good guess,&#8221; Halson said, running
his merry eyes over our faces.</p>

<p>&#8220;Anybody can give a good guess,&#8221; Rulledge said.
&#8220;Wanhope is doing it now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t let me interrupt.&#8221; Halson turned to him
politely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not at all. I&#8217;d rather hear your guess, if you know
Braybridge better than I,&#8221; Wanhope said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; Halson compromised, &#8220;perhaps I&#8217;ve
known him longer.&#8221; He asked, with an effect of coming to business:
&#8220;Where were you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell him, Rulledge,&#8221; Minver ordered, and Rulledge
apparently asked nothing better. He told him, in detail, all we knew
from any source, down to the moment of Wanhope&#8217;s arrested
conjecture.</p>

<p>&#8220;He did leave you at an anxious point, didn&#8217;t he?&#8221;
Halson smiled to the rest of us at Rulledge&#8217;s expense, and then
said: &#8220;Well, I think I can help you out a little. Any of you know
the lady?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By sight, Minver does,&#8221; Rulledge answered for us.
&#8220;Wants to paint her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; Halson said, with intelligence. &#8220;But I
doubt if he&#8217;d find her as paintable as she looks, at first.
She&#8217;s beautiful, but her charm is spiritual.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sometimes we try for that,&#8221; the painter interposed.</p>

<p>&#8220;And sometimes you get it. But you&#8217;ll allow it&#8217;s
difficult. That&#8217;s all I meant. I&#8217;ve known her&#8212;let me
see&#8212;for twelve years, at least; ever since I first went West. She
was about eleven then, and her father was bringing her up on the ranch.
Her aunt came along by and by and took her to Europe&#8212;mother dead
before Hazelwood went out there. But the girl was always homesick for
the ranch; she pined for it; and after they had kept her in Germany
three or four years they let her come back and run wild again&#8212;wild
as a flower does, or a vine, not a domesticated animal.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go slow, Halson. This is getting too much for the romantic
Rulledge.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Rulledge can bear up against the facts, I guess,
Minver,&#8221; Halson said, almost austerely. &#8220;Her father died two
years ago, and then she <em>had</em> to come East, for her aunt simply
<em>wouldn&#8217;t</em> live on the ranch. She brought her on here, and
brought her out; I was at the coming-out tea; but the girl didn&#8217;t
take to the New York thing at all; I could see it from the start; she
wanted to get away from it with me, and talk about the ranch.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She felt that she was with the only genuine person among those
conventional people.&#8221;</p>

<p>Halson laughed at Minver&#8217;s thrust, and went on amiably:
&#8220;I don&#8217;t suppose that till she met Braybridge she was ever
quite at her ease with any man&#8212;or woman, for that matter. I
imagine, as you&#8217;ve done, that it was his fear of her that gave her
courage. She met him on equal terms. Isn&#8217;t that it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Wanhope assented to the question referred to him with a nod.</p>

<p>&#8220;And when they got lost from the rest of the party at that
picnic&#8212;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lost?&#8221; Rulledge demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, yes. Didn&#8217;t you know? But I ought to go back. They
said there never was anything prettier than the way she unconsciously
went for Braybridge the whole day. She wanted him, and she was a child
who wanted things frankly when she did want them. Then his being ten or
fifteen years older than she was, and so large and simple, made it
natural for a shy girl like her to assort herself with him when all the
rest were assorting themselves, as people do at such things. The
consensus of testimony is that she did it with the most transparent
unconsciousness, and&#8212;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who are your authorities?&#8221; Minver asked; Rulledge threw
himself back on the divan and beat the cushions with impatience.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it essential to give them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh no. I merely wondered. Go on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The authorities are all right. She had disappeared with him
before the others noticed. It was a thing that happened; there was no
design in it; that would have been out of character. They had got to the
end of the wood-road, and into the thick of the trees where there
wasn&#8217;t even a trail, and they walked round looking for a way out
till they were turned completely. They decided that the only way was to
keep walking, and by and by they heard the sound of chopping. It was
some Canucks clearing a piece of the woods, and when she spoke to them
in French they gave them full directions, and Braybridge soon found the
path again.&#8221;</p>

<p>Halson paused, and I said: &#8220;But that isn&#8217;t
all?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh no.&#8221; He continued thoughtfully silent for a little
while before he resumed. &#8220;The amazing thing is that they got lost
again, and that when they tried going back to the Canucks they
couldn&#8217;t find the way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t they follow the sound of the chopping?&#8221;
I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Canucks had stopped, for the time being. Besides,
Braybridge was rather ashamed, and he thought if they went straight on
they would be sure to come out somewhere. But that was where he made a
mistake. They couldn&#8217;t go on straight; they went round and round,
and came on their own footsteps&#8212;or hers, which he recognized from
the narrow tread and the dint of the little heels in the damp
places.&#8221;</p>

<p>Wanhope roused himself with a kindling eye. &#8220;That is very
interesting, the movement in a circle of people who have lost their way.
It has often been observed, but I don&#8217;t know that it has ever been
explained. Sometimes the circle is smaller, sometimes it is larger, but
I believe it is always a circle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it,&#8221; I queried, &#8220;like any other error
in life? We go round and round, and commit the old sins over
again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is very interesting,&#8221; Wanhope allowed.</p>

<p>&#8220;But do lost people really always walk in a vicious
circle?&#8221; Minver asked.</p>

<p>Rulledge would not let Wanhope answer. &#8220;Go on, Halson,&#8221;
he said.</p>

<p>Halson roused himself from the revery in which he was sitting with
glazed eyes. &#8220;Well, what made it a little more anxious was that he
had heard of bears on that mountain, and the green afternoon light among
the trees was perceptibly paling. He suggested shouting, but she
wouldn&#8217;t let him; she said it would be ridiculous if the others
heard them, and useless if they didn&#8217;t. So they tramped on
till&#8212;till the accident happened.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The accident!&#8221; Rulledge exclaimed, in the voice of our
joint emotion.</p>

<p>&#8220;He stepped on a loose stone and turned his foot,&#8221; Halson
explained. &#8220;It wasn&#8217;t a sprain, luckily, but it hurt enough.
He turned so white that she noticed it, and asked him what was the
matter. Of course that shut his mouth the closer, but it morally doubled
his motive, and he kept himself from crying out till the sudden pain of
the wrench was over. He said merely that he thought he had heard
something, and he had an awful ringing in his ears; but he didn&#8217;t
mean that, and he started on again. The worst was trying to walk without
limping, and to talk cheerfully and encouragingly with that agony
tearing at him. But he managed somehow, and he was congratulating
himself on his success when he tumbled down in a dead faint.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, come now!&#8221; Minver protested.</p>

<p>&#8220;It <em>is</em> like an old-fashioned story, where things are
operated by accident instead of motive, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; Halson
smiled with radiant recognition.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fact will always imitate fiction, if you give her time
enough,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Had they got back to the other picnickers?&#8221; Rulledge
asked, with a tense voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;In sound, but not in sight of them. She wasn&#8217;t going to
bring him into camp in that state; besides, she couldn&#8217;t. She got
some water out of the trout-brook they&#8217;d been fishing&#8212;more
water than trout in it&#8212;and sprinkled his face, and he came to, and
got on his legs just in time to pull on to the others, who were
organizing a search-party to go after them. From that point on she
dropped Braybridge like a hot coal; and as there was nothing of the
flirt in her, she simply kept with the women, the older girls, and the
tabbies, and left Braybridge to worry along with the secret of his
turned ankle. He doesn&#8217;t know how he ever got home alive; but he
did, somehow, manage to reach the wagons that had brought them to the
edge of the woods, and then he was all right till they got to the house.
But still she said nothing about his accident, and he couldn&#8217;t;
and he pleaded an early start for town the next morning, and got off to
bed as soon as he could.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t have thought he could have stirred in the
morning,&#8221; Rulledge employed Halson&#8217;s pause to say.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, this beaver <em>had</em> to,&#8221; Halson said.
&#8220;He was not the only early riser. He found Miss Hazelwood at the
station before him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; Rulledge shouted. I confess the fact rather
roused me, too; and Wanhope&#8217;s eyes kindled with a scientific
pleasure.</p>

<p>&#8220;She came right towards him. &#8216;Mr. Braybridge,&#8217; says
she, &#8216;I couldn&#8217;t let you go without explaining my very
strange behavior. I didn&#8217;t choose to have these people laughing at
the notion of <em>my</em> having played the part of your preserver. It
was bad enough being lost with you; I couldn&#8217;t bring you into
ridicule with them by the disproportion they&#8217;d have felt in my
efforts for you after you turned your foot. So I simply had to ignore
the incident. Don&#8217;t you see?&#8217; Braybridge glanced at her, and
he had never felt so big and bulky before, or seen her so slender and
little. He said, &#8216;It <em>would</em> have seemed rather
absurd,&#8217; and he broke out and laughed, while she broke down and
cried, and asked him to forgive her, and whether it had hurt him very
much; and said she knew he could bear to keep it from the others by the
way he had kept it from her till he fainted. She implied that he was
morally as well as physically gigantic, and it was as much as he could
do to keep from taking her in his arms on the spot.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It would have been edifying to the groom that had driven her
to the station,&#8221; Minver cynically suggested.</p>

<p>&#8220;Groom nothing!&#8221; Halson returned with spirit. &#8220;She
paddled herself across the lake, and walked from the boat-landing to the
station.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Jove!&#8221; Rulledge exploded in uncontrollable
enthusiasm.</p>

<p>&#8220;She turned round as soon as she had got through with her hymn
of praise&#8212;it made Braybridge feel awfully flat&#8212;and ran back
through the bushes to the boat-landing, and&#8212;that was the last he
saw of her till he met her in town this fall.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And when&#8212;and when&#8212;did he offer himself?&#8221;
Rulledge entreated, breathlessly. &#8220;How&#8212;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s the point, Halson,&#8221; Minver interposed.
&#8220;Your story is all very well, as far as it goes; but Rulledge here
has been insinuating that it was Miss Hazelwood who made the offer, and
he wants you to bear him out.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rulledge winced at the outrage, but he would not stay Halson&#8217;s
answer even for the sake of righting himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;I <em>have</em> heard,&#8221; Minver went on, &#8220;that
Braybridge insisted on paddling the canoe back to the other shore for
her, and that it was on the way that he offered himself.&#8221; We
others stared at Minver in astonishment. Halson glanced covertly towards
him with his gay eyes. &#8220;Then that wasn&#8217;t true?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How did you hear it?&#8221; Halson asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, never mind. Is it true?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I know there&#8217;s that version,&#8221; Halson said,
evasively. &#8220;The engagement is only just out, as you know. As to
the offer&#8212;the when and the how&#8212;I don&#8217;t know that
I&#8217;m exactly at liberty to say.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see why,&#8221; Minver urged. &#8220;You might
stretch a point for Rulledge&#8217;s sake.&#8221;</p>

<p>Halson looked down, and then he glanced at Minver after a furtive
passage of his eye over Rulledge&#8217;s intense face. &#8220;There was
something rather nice happened after&#8212;But, really, now!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, go on!&#8221; Minver called out in contempt of his
scruple.</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t the right&#8212;Well, I suppose I&#8217;m on
safe ground here? It won&#8217;t go any further, of course; and it
<em>was</em> so pretty! After she had pushed off in her canoe, you know,
Braybridge&#8212;he&#8217;d followed her down to the shore of the
lake&#8212;found her handkerchief in a bush where it had caught, and he
held it up, and called out to her. She looked round and saw it, and
called back: &#8216;Never mind. I can&#8217;t return for it now.&#8217;
Then Braybridge plucked up his courage, and asked if he might keep it,
and she said &#8216;Yes,&#8217; over her shoulder, and then she stopped
paddling, and said: &#8216;No, no, you mustn&#8217;t, you mustn&#8217;t!
You can send it to me.&#8217; He asked where, and she said: &#8216;In
New York&#8212;in the fall&#8212;at the Walholland.&#8217; Braybridge
never knew how he dared, but he shouted after her&#8212;she was paddling
on again&#8212;&#8216;May I <em>bring</em> it?&#8217; and she called
over her shoulder again, without fully facing him, but her profile was
enough: &#8216;If you can&#8217;t get any one to bring it for
you.&#8217; The words barely reached him, but he&#8217;d have caught
them if they&#8217;d been whispered; and he watched her across the lake
and into the bushes, and then broke for his train. He was just in
time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Halson beamed for pleasure upon us, and even Minver said: &#8220;Yes,
that&#8217;s rather nice.&#8221; After a moment he added:
&#8220;Rulledge thinks she put it there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re too bad, Minver,&#8221; Halson protested.
&#8220;The charm of the whole thing was her perfect innocence. She
isn&#8217;t capable of the slightest finesse. I&#8217;ve known her from
a child, and I know what I say.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That innocence of girlhood,&#8221; Wanhope said, &#8220;is
very interesting. It&#8217;s astonishing how much experience it
survives. Some women carry it into old age with them. It&#8217;s never
been scientifically studied&#8212;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Minver allowed. &#8220;There would be a fortune
for the novelist who could work a type of innocence for all it was
worth. Here&#8217;s Acton always dealing with the most rancid
flirtatiousness, and missing the sweetness and beauty of a girlhood
which does the cheekiest things without knowing what it&#8217;s about,
and fetches down its game whenever it shuts its eyes and fires at
nothing. But I don&#8217;t see how all this touches the point that
Rulledge makes, or decides which finally made the offer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, hadn&#8217;t the offer already been made?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But how?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, in the usual way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is the usual way?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought everybody knew <em>that</em>. Of course, it was
<em>from</em> Braybridge finally, but I suppose it&#8217;s always six of
one and half a dozen of the other in these cases, isn&#8217;t it? I dare
say he couldn&#8217;t get any one to take her the handkerchief. My
dinner?&#8221; Halson looked up at the silent waiter, who had stolen
upon us and was bowing towards him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here, Halson,&#8221; Minver detained him, &#8220;how is
it none of the rest of us have heard all those details?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<em>I</em> don&#8217;t know where you&#8217;ve been, Minver.
Everybody knows the main facts,&#8221; Halson said, escaping.</p>

<p>Wanhope observed, musingly: &#8220;I suppose he&#8217;s quite right
about the reciprocality of the offer, as we call it. There&#8217;s
probably, in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred, a perfect understanding
before there&#8217;s an explanation. In many cases the offer and the
acceptance must really be tacit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; I ventured, &#8220;and I don&#8217;t know why
we&#8217;re so severe with women when they seem to take the initiative.
It&#8217;s merely, after all, the call of the maiden bird, and
there&#8217;s nothing lovelier or more endearing in nature than
that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maiden bird is good, Acton,&#8221; Minver approved. &#8220;Why
don&#8217;t you institute a class of fiction where the love-making is
all done by the maiden birds, as you call them&#8212;or the widow birds?
It would be tremendously popular with both sexes. It would lift an
immense responsibility off the birds who&#8217;ve been expected to
shoulder it heretofore if it could be introduced into real
life.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rulledge fetched a long, simple-hearted sigh. &#8220;Well, it&#8217;s
a charming story. How well he told it!&#8221;</p>

<p>The waiter came again, and this time signalled to Minver.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said, as he rose. &#8220;What a pity you
can&#8217;t believe a word Halson says.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean&#8212;&#8221; we began simultaneously.</p>

<p>&#8220;That he built the whole thing from the ground up, with the
start that we had given him. Why, you poor things! Who could have told
him how it all happened? Braybridge? Or the girl? As Wanhope began by
saying, people don&#8217;t speak of their love-making, even when they
distinctly remember it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but see here, Minver!&#8221; Rulledge said, with a dazed
look. &#8220;If it&#8217;s all a fake of his, how came <em>you</em> to
have heard of Braybridge paddling the canoe back for her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That was the fake that tested the fake. When he adopted it, I
<em>knew</em> he was lying, because I was lying myself. And then the
cheapness of the whole thing! I wonder that didn&#8217;t strike you.
It&#8217;s the stuff that a thousand summer-girl stories have been spun
out of. Acton might have thought he was writing it!&#8221;</p>

<p>He went away, leaving us to a blank silence, till Wanhope managed to
say: &#8220;That inventive habit of mind is very curious. It would be
interesting to know just how far it imposes on the inventor
himself&#8212;how much he believes of his own fiction.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see,&#8221; Rulledge said, gloomily, &#8220;why
they&#8217;re so long with my dinner.&#8221; Then he burst out: &#8220;I
believe every word Halson said! If there&#8217;s any fake in the thing,
it&#8217;s the fake that Minver owned to.&#8221;</p>




<h2><a name="chapter7" id="chapter7">VII</a></h2>

<h2 class="chaptertitle">The Chick of the Easter Egg</h2>


<p>The old fellow who told that story of dream-transference on a
sleeping-car at Christmas-time was again at the club on Easter Eve.
Halson had put him up for the winter, under the easy rule we had, and he
had taken very naturally to the Turkish room for his after-dinner coffee
and cigar. We all rather liked him, though it was Minver&#8217;s pose to
be critical of the simple friendliness with which he made himself at
home among us, and to feign a wish that there were fewer trains between
Boston and New York, so that old Newton (that was his name) could have a
better chance of staying away. But we noticed that Minver was always a
willing listener to Newton&#8217;s talk, and that he sometimes
hospitably offered to share his tobacco with the Bostonian. When brought
to book for his inconsistency by Rulledge, he said he was merely
welcoming the new blood, if not young blood, that Newton was infusing
into our body, which had grown anaemic on Wanhope&#8217;s psychology and
Rulledge&#8217;s romance; or, anyway, it was a change.</p>

<p>Newton now began by saying abruptly, in a fashion he had, &#8220;We
used to hear a good deal in Boston about your Easter Parade here in New
York. Do you still keep it up?&#8221;</p>

<p>No one else answering, Minver replied, presently, &#8220;I believe it
is still going on. I understand that it&#8217;s composed mostly of
milliners out to see one another&#8217;s new hats, and generous Jewesses
who are willing to contribute the &#8216;dark and bright&#8217; of the
beauty in which they walk to the observance of an alien faith.
It&#8217;s rather astonishing how the synagogue takes to the feasts of
the church. If it were not for that, I don&#8217;t know what would
become of Christmas.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean by their walking in beauty?&#8221; Rulledge
asked over his shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall never have the measure of your ignorance, Rulledge.
You don&#8217;t even know Byron&#8217;s lines on Hebrew loveliness?</p>

<p class="poetry">&#8220;&#8216;She walks in beauty like the night
<br /><span style="padding-left: 2em">Of cloudless climes and starry
  skies,</span>
<br />And all that&#8217;s best of dark and bright
<br /><span style="padding-left: 2em">Meets in her aspect and her
  eyes.&#8217;&#8221;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Pretty good,&#8221; Rulledge assented. &#8220;And they
<em>are</em> splendid, sometimes. But what has the Easter Parade got to
do with it?&#8221; he asked Newton.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, only what everything has with everything else. I was
thinking of Easter-time long ago and far away, and naturally I thought
of Easter now and here. I saw your Parade once, and it seemed to me one
of the great social spectacles. But you can&#8217;t keep anything in New
York, if it&#8217;s good; if it&#8217;s bad, you can.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You come from Boston, I think you said, Mr. Newton,&#8221;
Minver breathed blandly through his smoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m not a <em>real</em> Bostonian,&#8221; our guest
replied. &#8220;I&#8217;m not abusing you on behalf of a city that
I&#8217;m a native proprietor of. If I were, I shouldn&#8217;t perhaps
make your decadent Easter Parade my point of attack, though I think
it&#8217;s a pity to let it spoil. I came from a part of the country
where we used to make a great deal of Easter, when we were boys, at
least so far as eggs went. I don&#8217;t know whether the grown people
observed the day then, and I don&#8217;t know whether the boys keep it
now; I haven&#8217;t been back at Easter-time for several generations.
But when I was a boy it was a serious thing. In that soft Southwestern
latitude the grass had pretty well greened up by Easter, even when it
came in March, and grass colors eggs a very nice yellow; it used to
worry me that it didn&#8217;t color them green. When the grass
hadn&#8217;t got along far enough, winter wheat would do as well. I
don&#8217;t remember what color onion husks would give; but we used
onion husks, too. Some mothers would let the boys get logwood from the
drug-store, and that made the eggs a fine, bold purplish black. But the
greatest egg of all was a calico egg, that you got by coaxing your
grandmother (your mother&#8217;s mother) or your aunt (your
mother&#8217;s sister) to sew up in a tight cover of brilliant calico.
When that was boiled long enough the colors came off in a perfect
pattern on the egg. Very few boys could get such eggs; when they did,
they put them away in bureau drawers till they ripened and the mothers
smelt them, and threw them out of the window as quickly as possible.
Always, after breakfast, Easter Morning, we came out on the street and
fought eggs. We pitted the little ends of the eggs against one another,
and the fellow whose egg cracked the other fellow&#8217;s egg won it,
and he carried it off. I remember grass and wheat colored eggs in such
trials of strength, and onion and logwood colored eggs; but never calico
eggs; <em>they</em> were too precious to be risked; it would have seemed
wicked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; the Boston man went musingly on,
&#8220;why I should remember these things so relentlessly; I&#8217;ve
forgotten all the important things that happened to me then; but perhaps
these were the important things. Who knows? I only know I&#8217;ve
always had a soft spot in my heart for Easter, not so much because of
the calico eggs, perhaps, as because of the grandmothers and the aunts.
I suppose the simple life is full of such aunts and grandmothers still;
but you don&#8217;t find them in hotel apartments, or even in flats
consisting of seven large, light rooms and bath.&#8221; We all
recognized the language of the advertisements, and laughed in sympathy
with our guest, who perhaps laughed out of proportion with a pleasantry
of that size.</p>

<p>When he had subdued his mirth, he resumed at a point apparently very
remote from that where he had started.</p>

<p>&#8220;There was one of those winters in Cambridge, where I lived
then, that seemed tougher than any other we could remember, and they
were all pretty tough winters there in those times. There were forty
snowfalls between Thanksgiving and Fast Day&#8212;you don&#8217;t know
what Fast Day is in New York, and we didn&#8217;t, either, as far as the
fasting went&#8212;and the cold kept on and on till we couldn&#8217;t,
or said we couldn&#8217;t, stand it any longer. So, along about the
middle of March somewhere, we picked up the children and started south.
In those days New York seemed pretty far south to us; and when we got
here we found everything on wheels that we had left on runners in
Boston. But the next day it began to snow, and we said we must go a
little farther to meet the spring. I don&#8217;t know exactly what it
was made us pitch on Bethlehem, Pennsylvania; but we had a notion we
should find it interesting, and, at any rate, a total change from our
old environment. We had been reading something about the Moravians, and
we knew that it was the capital of Moravianism, with the largest
Moravian congregation in the world; I think it was Longfellow&#8217;s
&#8216;Hymn of the Moravian Nuns&#8217; that set us to reading about the
sect; and we had somehow heard that the Sun Inn, at Bethlehem, was the
finest old-fashioned public house anywhere. At any rate, we had the
faith of our youthful years, and we put out for Bethlehem.</p>

<p>&#8220;We arrived just at dusk, but not so late that we
couldn&#8217;t see the hospitable figure of a man coming out of the Sun
to meet us at the omnibus door and to shake hands with each of us. It
was the very pleasantest and sweetest welcome we ever had at a public
house; and though we found the Sun a large, modern hotel, we easily
accepted the landlord&#8217;s assurance that the old Inn was built up
inside of the hotel, just as it was when Washington stayed in it; and
after a mighty good supper we went to our rooms, which were piping warm
from two good base-burner stoves. It was not exactly the vernal air we
had expected of Bethlehem when we left New York; but you can&#8217;t
have everything in this world, and, with the snowbanks along the streets
outside, we were very glad to have the base-burners.</p>

<p>&#8220;We went to bed pretty early, and I fell into one of those
exemplary sleeps that begin with no margin of waking after your head
touches the pillow, or before that, even, and I woke from a dream of
heavenly music that translated itself into the earthly notes of bugles.
It made me sit up with the instant realization that we had arrived in
Bethlehem on Easter Eve, and that this was Easter Morning. We had read
of the beautiful observance of the feast by the Moravians, and, while I
was hurrying on my clothes beside my faithful base-burner, I kept quite
superfluously wondering at myself for not having thought of it, and so
made sure of being called. I had waked just in time, though I
hadn&#8217;t deserved to do so, and ought, by right, to have missed it
all. I tried to make my wife come with me; but after the family is of a
certain size a woman, if she is a real woman, thinks her husband can see
things for her, and generally sends him out to reconnoitre and report.
Besides, my wife couldn&#8217;t have left the children without waking
them, to tell them she was going, and then all five of them would have
wanted to come with us, including the baby; and we should have had no
end of a time convincing them of the impossibility. We were a good deal
bound up in the children, and we hated to lie to them when we could
possibly avoid it. So I went alone.</p>

<p>&#8220;I asked the night porter, who was still on duty, the way I
wanted to take, but there were so many people in the streets going the
same direction that I couldn&#8217;t have missed it, anyhow; and pretty
soon we came to the old Moravian cemetery, which was in the heart of the
town; and there we found most of the Moravian congregation drawn up on
three sides of the square, waiting and facing the east, which was
beginning to redden. Of all the cemeteries I have seen, that was the
most beautiful, because it was the simplest and humblest. Generally a
cemetery is a dreadful place, with headstones and footstones and shafts
and tombs scattered about, and looking like a field full of granite and
marble stumps from the clearing of a petrified forest. But here all the
memorial tablets lay flat with the earth. None of the dead were assumed
to be worthier of remembrance than another; they all rested at regular
intervals, with their tablets on their breasts, like shields, in their
sleep after the battle of life. I was thinking how right and wise this
was, and feeling the purity of the conception like a quality of the
keen, clear air of the morning, which seemed to be breathing straight
from the sky, when suddenly the sun blazed up from the horizon like a
fire, and the instant it appeared the horns of the band began to blow
and the people burst into a hymn&#8212;a thousand voices, for all I
know. It was the sublimest thing I ever heard, and I don&#8217;t know
that there&#8217;s anything to match it for dignity and solemnity in any
religious rite. It made the tears come, for I thought how those people
were of a church of missionaries and martyrs from the beginning, and I
felt as if I were standing in sight and hearing of the first Christians
after Christ. It was as if He were risen there &#8216;in the midst of
them.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Rulledge looked round on the rest of us, with an air of acquiring
merit from the Bostonian&#8217;s poetry, but Minver&#8217;s gravity was
proof against the chance of mocking Rulledge, and I think we all felt
alike. Wanhope seemed especially interested, though he said nothing.</p>

<p>&#8220;When I went home I told my wife about it as well as I could,
but, though she entered into the spirit of it, she was rather
preoccupied. The children had all wakened, as they did sometimes, in a
body, and were storming joyfully around the rooms, as if it were
Christmas; and she was trying to get them dressed. &#8216;Do tell them
what Easter is like; they&#8217;ve never seen it kept before,&#8217; she
said; and I tried to do so, while I took a hand, as a young father will,
and tried to get them into their clothes. I don&#8217;t think I dwelt
much on the religious observance of the day, but I dug up some of my
profane associations with it in early life, and told them about coloring
eggs, and fighting them, and all that; there in New England, in those
days, they had never seen or heard of such a thing as an Easter egg.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think my reminiscences quieted them much. They
were all on fire&#8212;the oldest hoy and girl, and the twins, and even
the two-year-old that we called the baby&#8212;to go out and buy some
eggs and get the landlord to let them color them in the hotel kitchen. I
had a deal of ado to make them wait till after breakfast, but I managed,
somehow; and when we had finished&#8212;it was a mighty good
Pennsylvania breakfast, such as we could eat with impunity in those
halcyon days: rich coffee, steak, sausage, eggs, applebutter, buckwheat
cakes and maple syrup&#8212;we got their out-door togs on them, while
they were all stamping and shouting round and had to be caught and
overcoated, and fur-capped and hooded simultaneously, and managed to get
them into the street together. Ever been in Bethlehem?&#8221;</p>

<p>We all had to own our neglect of this piece of travel; and Newton,
after a moment of silent forgiveness, said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t know how it is now, but twenty-five or
thirty years ago it was the most interesting town in America. It
wasn&#8217;t the old Moravian community that it had been twenty-five
years before that, when none but Moravians could buy property there; but
it was like the Sun Hotel, and just as that had grown round and over the
old Sun Inn, the prosperous manufacturing town, with its iron-foundries
and zinc-foundries, and all the rest of it, had grown round and over the
original Moravian village. If you wanted a breath of perfect
strangeness, with an American quality in it at the same time, you
couldn&#8217;t have gone to any place where you could have had it on
such terms as you could in Bethlehem. I can&#8217;t begin to go into
details, but one thing was hearing German spoken everywhere in the
street: not the German of Germany, but the Pennsylvania German, with its
broad vowels and broken-down grammatical forms, and its English vocables
and interjections, which you caught in the sentences which came to you,
like <i>av coorse</i>, and <i>yes</i> and <i>no</i> for <i>ja</i> and <i>nein</i>. There were
stores where they spoke no English, and others where they made a
specialty of it; and I suppose when we sallied out that bright Sunday
morning, with the baby holding onto a hand of each of us between us, and
the twins going in front with their brother and sister, we were almost
as foreign as we should have been in a village on the Rhine or the
Elbe.</p>

<p>&#8220;We got a little acquainted with the people, after awhile, and
I heard some stories of the country folks that I thought were pretty
good. One was about an old German farmer on whose land a prospecting
metallurgist found zinc ore; the scientific man brought him the bright
yellow button by which the zinc proved its existence in its union with
copper, and the old fellow asked in an awestricken whisper: &#8216;Is it
a gold-mine?&#8217; &#8216;No, no. Guess again.&#8217; &#8216;Then
it&#8217;s a <em>brass-mine</em>!&#8217; But before they began to find
zinc there in the lovely Lehigh Valley&#8212;you can stand by an open
zinc-mine and look down into it where the rock and earth are left
standing, and you seem to be looking down into a range of sharp mountain
peaks and pinnacles&#8212;it was the richest farming region in the whole
fat State of Pennsylvania; and there was a young farmer who owned a vast
tract of it, and who went to fetch home a young wife from Philadelphia
way, somewhere. He drove there and back in his own buggy, and when he
reached the top overlooking the valley, with his bride, he stopped his
horse, and pointed with his whip. &#8216;There,&#8217; he said,
&#8216;as far as the sky is blue, it&#8217;s all ours!&#8217; I thought
that was fine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fine?&#8221; I couldn&#8217;t help bursting out;
&#8220;it&#8217;s a stroke of poetry.&#8221;</p>

<p>Minver cut in: &#8220;The thrifty Acton making a note of it for
future use in literature.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Eh!&#8221; Newton queried. &#8220;Oh! I don&#8217;t mind.
You&#8217;re welcome to it, Mr. Acton. It&#8217;s a pity somebody
shouldn&#8217;t use it, and of course <em>I</em> can&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Acton will send you a copy with the usual forty-per-cent.
discount and ten off for cash,&#8221; the painter said.</p>

<p>They had their little laugh at my expense, and then Newton took up
his tale again. &#8220;Well, as I was saying&#8212;By the way, what
<em>was</em> I saying?&#8221;</p>

<p>The story-loving Rulledge remembered. &#8220;You went out with your
wife and children for Easter eggs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh yes. Thank you. Well, of course, in a town geographically
American, the shops were all shut on Sunday, and we couldn&#8217;t buy
even an Easter egg on Easter Sunday. But one of the stores had the shade
of its show-window up, and the children simply glued themselves to it in
such a fascination that we could hardly unstick them. That window was
full of all kinds of Easter things&#8212;I don&#8217;t remember what
all; but there were Easter eggs in every imaginable color and pattern,
and besides these there were whole troops of toy rabbits. I had
forgotten that the natural offspring of Easter eggs is rabbits; but I
took a brace, and remembered the fact and announced it to the children.
They immediately demanded an explanation, with all sorts of scientific
particulars, which I gave them, as reckless of the truth as I thought my
wife would suffer without contradicting me. I had to say that while
Easter eggs mostly hatched rabbits, there were instances in which they
hatched other things, as, for instance, handfuls of eagles and
half-eagles and double-eagles, especially in the case of the golden eggs
that the goose laid. They knew all about that goose; but I had to tell
them what those unfamiliar pieces of American coinage were, and promise
to give them one each when they grew up, if they were good. That only
partially satisfied them, and they wanted to know specifically what
other kinds of things Easter eggs would hatch if properly treated. Each
one had a preference; the baby always preferred what the last one said;
and <em>she</em> wanted an ostrich, the same as her big brother; he was
seven then.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t really know how we lived through the day; I mean
the children, for my wife and I went to the Moravian church, and had a
good long Sunday nap in the afternoon, while the children were pining
for Monday morning, when they could buy eggs and begin to color them, so
that they could hatch just the right kind of Easter things. When I woke
up I had to fall in with a theory they had agreed to between them that
any kind of two-legged or four-legged chick that hatched from an Easter
egg would wear the same color, or the same kind of spots or stripes,
that the egg had.</p>

<p>&#8220;I found that they had arranged to have calico eggs, and they
were going to have their mother cover them with the same sort of cotton
prints that I had said my grandmother and aunts used, and they meant to
buy the calico in the morning at the same time that they bought the
eggs. We had some tin vessels of water on our stoves to take the dryness
out of the hot air, and they had decided that they would boil their eggs
in these, and not trouble the landlord for the use of his kitchen.</p>

<p>&#8220;There was nothing in this scheme wanting but their
mother&#8217;s consent&#8212;I agreed to it on the spot&#8212;but when
she understood that they each expected to have two eggs apiece, with one
apiece for us, she said she never could cover a dozen eggs in the world,
and that the only way would be for them to go in the morning with us,
and choose each the handsomest egg they could out of the eggs in that
shop-window. They met this proposition rather blankly at first; but on
reflection the big brother said it would be a shame to spoil
mamma&#8217;s Easter by making her work all day, and besides it would
keep till that night, anyway, before they could begin to have any fun
with their eggs; and then the rest all said the same thing, ending with
the baby: and accepted the inevitable with joy, and set about living
through the day as well as they could.</p>

<p>&#8220;They had us up pretty early the next morning&#8212;that is,
they had me up; their mother said that I had brought it on myself, and
richly deserved it for exciting their imaginations, and I had to go out
with the two oldest and the twins to choose the eggs; we got off from
the baby by promising to let her have two, and she didn&#8217;t
understand very well, anyway, and was awfully sleepy. We were a pretty
long time choosing the six eggs, and I don&#8217;t remember now just
what they were; but they were certainly joyous eggs; and&#8212;By the
way, I don&#8217;t know why I&#8217;m boring a brand of hardened
bachelors like you with all these domestic details?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t mind <em>us</em>,&#8221; Minver responded to
his general appeal. &#8220;We may not understand the feelings of a
father, but we are all mothers at heart, especially Rulledge. Go on.
It&#8217;s very exciting,&#8221; he urged, not very ironically, and
Newton went on.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t believe I could say just how the havoc
began. They put away their eggs very carefully after they had made their
mother admire them, and shown the baby how hers were the prettiest, and
they each said in succession that they must be very precious of them,
for if you shook an egg, or anything, it wouldn&#8217;t hatch; and it
was their plan to take these home and set an unemployed pullet,
belonging to the big brother, to hatching them in the coop that he had
built of laths for her in the back yard with his own hands. But long
before the afternoon was over, the evil one had entered Eden, and
tempted the boy to try fighting eggs with these treasured specimens, as
I had told we boys used to fight eggs in my town in the southwest. He
held a conquering course through the encounter with three eggs, but met
his Waterloo with a regular Bl&#252;cher belonging to the baby. Then he
instantly changed sides; and smashed his Bl&#252;cher against the last egg
left. By that time all the other children were in tears, the baby
roaring powerfully in ignorant sympathy, and the victor steeped in
silent gloom. His mother made him gather up the ruins from the floor,
and put them in the stove, and she took possession of the victorious
egg, and said she would keep it till we got back to Cambridge herself,
and not let one of them touch it. I can tell you it was a tragical time.
I wanted to go out and buy them another set of eggs, and spring them for
a surprise on them in the morning, after they had suffered enough that
night. But she said that if I dared to dream of such a thing&#8212;which
would be the ruin of the children&#8217;s character, by taking away the
consequences of their folly&#8212;she should do, she did not know what,
to me. Of course she was right, and I gave in, and helped the children
forget all about it, so that by the time we got back to Cambridge I had
forgotten about it myself.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what it was reminded the boy of that
remaining Easter egg unless it was the sight of the unemployed pullet in
her coop, which he visited the first thing; and I don&#8217;t know how
he managed to wheedle his mother out of it; but the first night after I
came home from business&#8212;it was rather late and the children had
gone to bed&#8212;she told me that ridiculous boy, as she called him in
self-exculpation, had actually put the egg under his pullet, and all the
children were wild to see what it would hatch. &#8216;And now,&#8217;
she said, severely, &#8216;what are you going to do? You have filled
their heads with those ideas, and I suppose you will have to invent some
nonsense or other to fool them, and make them believe that it has
hatched a giraffe, or an elephant, or something; they won&#8217;t be
satisfied with anything less.&#8217; I said we should have to try
something smaller, for I didn&#8217;t think we could manage a chick of
that size on our lot; and that I should trust in Providence. Then she
said it was all very well to laugh; and that I couldn&#8217;t get out of
it that way, and I needn&#8217;t think it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t, much. But the children understood that it took
three weeks for an egg to hatch, and anyway the pullet was so
intermittent in her attentions to the Easter egg, only sitting on it at
night, or when held down by hand in the day, that there was plenty of
time. One evening when I came out from Boston, I was met by a doleful
deputation at the front gate, with the news that when the coop was
visited that morning after breakfast&#8212;they visited the coop every
morning before they went to school&#8212;the pullet was found perched on
a cross-bar in a high state of nerves, and the shell of the Easter egg
broken and entirely eaten out. Probably a rat had got in and done it,
or, more hopefully, a mink, such as used to attack eggs in the town
where I was a boy. We went out and viewed the wreck, as a first step
towards a better situation; and suddenly a thought struck me.
&#8216;Children,&#8217; I said, &#8216;what did you really expect that
egg to hatch, anyway?&#8217; They looked askance at one another, and at
last the boy said: &#8216;Well, you know, papa, an egg that&#8217;s been
cooked&#8212;&#8217; And then we all laughed together, and I knew they
had been making believe as much as I had, and no more expected the
impossible of a boiled egg than I did.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That was charming!&#8221; Wanhope broke out. &#8220;There is
nothing more interesting than the way children join in hypnotizing
themselves with the illusions which their parents think <em>they</em>
have created without their help. In fact, it is very doubtful whether at
any age we have any illusions except those of our own creation;
we&#8212;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let him go on, Wanhope,&#8221; Minver dictated; and Newton
continued.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was rather nice. I asked them if their mother knew about
the egg; and they said that of course they couldn&#8217;t help telling
her; and I said: &#8216;Well, then, I&#8217;ll tell you what: we must
make her believe that the chick hatched out and got away&#8212;&#8217;
The boy stopped me: &#8216;Do you think that would be exactly true,
papa?&#8217; &#8216;Well, not <em>exactly</em> true; but it&#8217;s only
for the time being. We can tell her the exact truth afterwards,&#8217;
and then I laid my plan before them. They said it was perfectly
splendid, and would be the greatest kind of joke on mamma, and one that
she would like as much as anybody. The thing was to keep it from her
till it was done, and they all promised that they wouldn&#8217;t tell;
but I could see that they were bursting with the secret the whole
evening.</p>

<p>&#8220;The next day was Saturday, when I always went home early, and
I had the two oldest children come in with the second-girl, who left
them to take lunch with me. They had chocolate and ice-cream, and after
lunch we went around to a milliner&#8217;s shop in West Street, where my
wife and I had stopped a long five minutes the week before we went to
Bethlehem, adoring an Easter bonnet that we saw in the window. I wanted
her to buy it; but she said, No, if we were going that expensive
journey, we couldn&#8217;t afford it, and she must do without, that
spring. I showed it to them, and &#8216;Now, children,&#8217; I said,
&#8216;what do you think of that for the chick that your Easter egg
hatched?&#8217; And they said it was the most beautiful bonnet they had
ever seen, and it would just exactly suit mamma. But I saw they were
holding something back, and I said, sharply, &#8216;Well?&#8217; and
they both guiltily faltered out: &#8216;The <em>bird</em>, you know,
papa,&#8217; and I remembered that they belonged to the society of Bird
Defenders, who in that day were pledged against the decorative use of
dead birds or killing them for anything but food. &#8216;Why, confound
it,&#8217; I said, &#8216;the bird is the very thing that makes it an
Easter-egg chick!&#8217; but I saw that their honest little hearts were
troubled, and I said again: &#8216;Confound it! Let&#8217;s go in and
hear what the milliner has to say.&#8217; Well, the long and short of it
was that the milliner tried a bunch of forget-me-nots over the bluebird
that we all agreed was a thousand times better, and that if it were
substituted would only cost three dollars more, and we took our
Easter-egg chick home in a blaze of glory, the children carrying the
bandbox by the string between them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course we had a great time opening it, and their mother
acted her part so well that I knew she was acting, and after the little
ones were in bed I taxed her with it. &#8216;Know? Of course I
knew!&#8217; she said. &#8216;Did you think they would let you
<em>deceive</em> me? They&#8217;re true New-Englanders, and they told me
all about it last night, when I was saying their prayers with
them.&#8217; &#8216;Well,&#8217; I said, &#8216;they let you deceive
<em>me;</em> they must be true Westerners, too, for they didn&#8217;t
tell me a word of your knowing.&#8217; I rather had her there, but she
said: &#8216;Oh, you goose&#8212;&#8217; We were young people in those
days, and goose meant everything. But, really, I&#8217;m ashamed of
getting off all this to you hardened bachelors, as I said
before&#8212;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you tell many more such stories in this club,&#8221; Minver
said, severely, &#8220;you won&#8217;t leave a bachelor in it. And
Rulledge will be the first to get married.&#8221;</p>

electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,

and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
